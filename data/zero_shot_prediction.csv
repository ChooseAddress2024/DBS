2025 Financial Crime Report - Kroll,"Executive Summary

By David Lewis and Thomas Bock

With AI-powered cybercrime disrupting businesses across industries and regulators imposing billion-dollar penalties for compliance failures, more than 70% of executives expect financial crime risk to increase in 2025—compared to 67% in 2023—yet only 23% believe their organization’s compliance program is “very effective” in combating it.

These are among the key takeaways from Kroll’s 2025 Financial Crime Report, which surveyed over 600 business leaders in the U.S., the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. Respondents included CEOs, chief compliance officers, general counsel, and chief risk officers from leading financial services, accounting, insurance and legal services firms.

In addition to assessing financial crime expectations, concerns and readiness for the year ahead, the report examines how AI can fight—or enable—illicit activity and captures current sentiment around geopolitical threats, evolving regulations, supply chain risks and more.",2025-03-18T07:00:00,https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/financial-crime-report-2025,"2025 Financial Crime Report - Kroll Executive Summary

Senators re-up bill to expand Secret Service’s financial cybercrime authorities - CyberScoop,"A bipartisan pair of senators is taking another shot at their bill to expand the U.S. Secret Service’s investigative powers for financial cybercrime probes.

The Combatting Money Laundering in Cyber Crime Act from Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, would update federal law to strengthen the Secret Service’s authority, enabling the agency to look into criminal activity tied to digital assets.

“Dangerous criminals are constantly changing their tactics and using new technology to avoid detection,” Cortez Masto said in a statement. “Our law enforcement agencies need to adapt to keep communities safe. I will continue to fight to pass this bipartisan legislation that would help the Secret Service more effectively combat cybercrime.”

Under current law, the Secret Service is empowered to investigate cybercrimes that threaten national security, but those that are conducted via unlicensed money transmitting businesses fall outside the agency’s purview.

The legislation from Cortez Masto and Grassley, both members of the Senate Finance Committee, addresses that gap by allowing Secret Service members to probe digital asset transactions tied to transnational cyber criminal activity.

“As money laundering schemes continue to evolve, so must our capacity to combat them,” Grassley said in a statement. “By enhancing Secret Service’s authority to investigate criminal digital assets, our bill significantly improves law enforcement’s ability to effectively anticipate, identify and prevent cybercrime.”

Cortez Masto and Grassley first introduced this bill last July, but the legislation didn’t make it out of committee. The Nevada Democrat told CyberScoop at the time that “the funding of criminal activity through digital assets poses a direct threat to the security and safety of our nation.”

The Secret Service’s history with combatting cybercrime dates back to 2004 and the launch of its internal Cyber Investigative Section, one of the U.S. government’s first units dedicated to cybercrime.

Five years ago, the agency created its Cyber Fraud Task Forces. Since then, there’s been a steady drumbeat from current and former federal cyber officials calling for the Secret Service, FBI and Treasury Department to invest in the hiring of agents with cyber skills to pursue financial investigations.

In January 2024, the Secret Service said it would relaunch its Cyber Investigations Advisory Board, a 16-member body tasked with overhauling financial cybercrime investigative practices at the agency.

The Department of Justice and Treasury Department have warned in recent years about the increasing frequency with which digital assets are being used in ransomware attacks, fraud schemes, money laundering and other crimes.

Cortez Masto has had a particular focus on cybercrime and cryptocurrency, co-sponsoring the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act and helping to get the FinCEN Improvement Act — which strengthened the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s powers — passed and signed into law.",2025-04-04T19:03:28,https://cyberscoop.com/secret-service-financial-cybercrimes-senate-bill/,"Senators re-up bill to expand Secret Service’s financial cybercrime authorities - CyberScoop A bipartisan pair of senators is taking another shot at their bill to expand the U.S. Secret Service’s investigative powers for financial cybercrime probes.

NICE Actimize Adds Agentic AI to Financial Crime Prevention Platform - PYMNTS.com,"NICE Actimize added agentic AI capabilities to X-Sight ActOne, the company’s platform for fraud and financial crime prevention.

Available through X-Sight ActOne’s InvestigateAI, the agentic AI capabilities orchestrate all fraud and financial crime prevention workflows on one platform, automate processes and engage human oversight only when necessary, the company said in a Wednesday (April 2) press release.

“This empowers financial institutions to scale operations and realize transformative cost and labor efficiencies,” NICE Actimize CEO Craig Costigan said in the release.

The agentic AI can autonomously craft an investigation plan based on a financial institution’s policy and procedures, understand the context of an investigation and execute upon the plan, and inject real-time data, according to the release.

It can also learn to become more effective with use, be trained to act upon many tasks, reverse prompt to engage humans when necessary, and provide explainability of its AI insights and actions so that there is full transparency and confidence for analysts and auditors, per the release.

“Equipped with AI and advanced analytics, the platform delivers outcomes and empowers investigators with the intelligence required for swift, accurate and efficient investigations,” the release said.

AI is arming companies to supercharge their defensive capabilities in terms of risk management, since trust and security are the foundation of financial transactions, PYMNTS reported March 19.

Meanwhile, Coupa added agentic AI features to its spend management platform in February, saying the offerings include a contract intelligence tool that improves contract language analysis and processes more contracts with standard and custom field extraction.

“Agentic AI will play a central role in making our collaborative global trade network grow,” Coupa Chief Product and Technology Officer Salvatore Lombardo said at the time in a press release.

During the same month, Routable enhanced its accounts payable automation platform by adding an AI agent that can detect invoice fraud and human error.

The AI agent scans invoices for anomalies and errors and, if it finds anything questionable, alerts AP teams to prevent fraud and error before it happens.

“AI has the power to help you do something humans can’t do, something previously impossible,” Routable CEO and co-founder Omri Mor said at the time in a press release.

Chartis Ranks Quantifind #1 in the Financial Crimes and Compliance 50 Report for Dynamic Risk Typologies--Underscoring why 7 of the top 10 banks in the US choose Quantifind - PR Newswire,"PALO ALTO, Calif., March 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- In a time when financial crime is evolving at an unprecedented pace, Quantifind has been recognized as the #1 AI Risk Intelligence Provider in the 2025 Financial Crimes and Compliance 50 (FCC50) Report by Chartis Research. This distinction reinforces Quantifind's leadership in AI-driven financial crime risk intelligence, equipping financial institutions, governments, and corporations with the power to detect, assess, and mitigate emerging threats with unparalleled accuracy, speed, and scale.

The Convergence of Financial Crime Risks Requires Advanced Intelligence

The global financial crime landscape has grown more complex, with illicit actors leveraging new technologies and geopolitical instability to exploit vulnerabilities across banking, fintech, and supply chain networks. Operation Destabilise, a U.K.-led initiative, recently uncovered a money-laundering network linking Russian operatives, European drug cartels, and cryptocurrency exchanges used to evade sanctions—a clear demonstration of how traditional organized crime, state actors, and emerging financial technologies are increasingly interconnected (Financial Times, 2024).

The ability to assess risk dynamically across multiple typologies—spanning sanctions evasion, fraud, money laundering, and human trafficking—is now mission-critical for compliance teams. Without real-time, AI-powered intelligence, financial institutions risk being reactive rather than proactive, allowing threats to materialize before they can be stopped.

""Financial crime networks operate across industries, borders, and regulatory frameworks—and fighting them requires a united front, said Annalisa Camarillo, EVP of Marketing at Quantifind."" "" On March 25, we are hosting the Human Trafficking Convergence event with our partners Polaris and Deloitte, major financial institutions, and public sector partners to leverage our AI-powered risk typologies in the real world. This event is about more than discussion; it's about action—applying financial crime intelligence to expose hidden networks and stop illicit finance at its source.

Why Quantifind is #1 in Risk Typology Functionality

Chartis' ranking evaluates vendors based on market influence, technological innovation, and strategic execution. Quantifind's top placement in Risk Typology Functionality reflects its ability to:

Deliver Accuracy in Risk Identification

This distinction reinforces Quantifind's leadership in AI-driven financial crime risk intelligence, equipping financial institutions, governments, and corporations with the power to detect, assess, and mitigate emerging threats with unparalleled accuracy, speed, and scale.

The Convergence of Financial Crime Risks Requires Advanced Intelligence

The global financial crime landscape has grown more complex, with illicit actors leveraging new technologies and geopolitical instability to exploit vulnerabilities across banking, fintech, and supply chain networks. Operation Destabilise, a U.K.-led initiative, recently uncovered a money-laundering network linking Russian operatives, European drug cartels, and cryptocurrency exchanges used to evade sanctions—a clear demonstration of how traditional organized crime, state actors, and emerging financial technologies are increasingly interconnected (Financial Times, 2024).

The ability to assess risk dynamically across multiple typologies—spanning sanctions evasion, fraud, money laundering, and human trafficking—is now mission-critical for compliance teams. Without real-time, AI-powered intelligence, financial institutions risk being reactive rather than proactive, allowing threats to materialize before they can be stopped.

""Financial crime networks operate across industries, borders, and regulatory frameworks—and fighting them requires a united front, said Annalisa Camarillo, EVP of Marketing at Quantifind."" "" On March 25, we are hosting the Human Trafficking Convergence event with our partners Polaris and Deloitte, major financial institutions, and public sector partners to leverage our AI-powered risk typologies in the real world. This event is about more than discussion; it's about action—applying financial crime intelligence to expose hidden networks and stop illicit finance at its source.

Why Quantifind is #1 in Risk Typology Functionality

Chartis' ranking evaluates vendors based on market influence, technological innovation, and strategic execution. Quantifind's top placement in Risk Typology Functionality reflects its ability to:

Fivecast revolutionizes financial crime investigations with AI-driven online insights - GlobeNewswire,"LONDON, March 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fivecast today launched its cutting-edge, AI-driven digital intelligence platform into the financial crime compliance market, enabling financial institutions to radically streamline financial crime investigations, anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), and enhanced due diligence (EDD) through online data analytics.

Fivecast empowers financial investigation teams to swiftly and efficiently assess customer risk across masses of online information. The Fivecast platform delivers relevant and actionable information from a vast range of online data sources, enabling broad digital footprint discovery combined with in-depth, AI-driven multi-media data analysis. Current sources and methods used for financial intelligence investigations are missing critical, risk-based information about customers, leading financial institutions to grossly underestimate their risk exposure.

The need for accurate, timely, and global data has never been greater. The global regulatory landscape is rapidly changing, demanding new data sources to meet evolving due diligence requirements for AML compliance. This is highlighted in guidance and consent orders from Government agencies and financial regulatory bodies across Europe, the US, and Australia. In 2024, global penalties related to financial crime imposed by U.S. regulators alone surpassed $4.3 billion.

Duane Rivett, Fivecast Co-founder and VP of Strategic Growth, said: “The vastly superior speed and accuracy of our digital intelligence platform streamlines slow, labor-intensive processes in a highly sensitive area for financial institutions. Just as national security agencies use our solutions to analyze extremist or terrorist networks online, banks are doing the same with a slightly different focus on EDD, AML, and KYC.”

Fivecast solutions empower financial investigation units to efficiently and accurately assess a customer’s risk profile to rapidly identify predicate crimes and customer risk exposure and adopt a genuine risk-based approach to compliance while minimizing compliance costs.

About Fivecast:

Fivecast is a world-leading provider of digital intelligence solutions that enable financial institutions to efficiently and accurately assess a customer’s risk profile, uncovering actionable insights critical to reducing business risk while driving down the cost of compliance. Fivecast was born out of a unique collaboration between government agencies and world-leading research institutions to tackle big data challenges like those facing financial institutions today.

How Consilient Is Innovating Financial Crime Prevention With AI - GovCon Wire,"According to noted national security expert Juan Zarate , financial institutions have been in dire need of updated management technologies to match the current threat landscape. All of the “illicit finance challenges,” as Zarate put it in exclusive comment to GovCon Wire, demand a more effective, efficient and flexible system.

That’s where Consilient comes in.

Zarate, who was deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism at the White House in the 2000s, co-founded Consilient in 2020 with Dr. Gary Shiffman , a government affairs expert in his own right who served in a top Department of Homeland Security position, taught at Georgetown University for decades and is a go-to authority in all things artificial intelligence. Zarate is also a two-time winner of the prestigious Wash100 Award, GovCon’s highest honor.

An AI Inflection Point

AI is crucial to Consilient’s strategy; the company was ahead of the curve with the technology, seizing upon federated machine learning as a prime route to combatting financial crime risk years before ChatGPT ushered in the AI boom.

At the Potomac Officers Club’s 2025 AI Summit on March 20, luminaries from government and industry will discuss AI’s potential in matters of logistics management, economics, cybersecurity, American defense and much more. Don’t miss this exciting GovCon conference — register before tickets are gone!

Along its half-decade journey, Consilient has formed key collaborations with Intel and K2 Integrity, as well as international entities like Harex InfoTech to establish an interconnected, global network of partners.

We wanted to know more about how Consilient is leveraging AI and ML, so we got in touch with Zarate for a further investigation into what is unique about the organization’s approach to anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, a.k.a. AML/CFT.

GovCon Wire: What problem is Consilient trying to solve?

Juan Zarate: Consilient’s mission is to be at the center of the redesign of this system so we are preventing financial crime and fraud more effectively and efficiently on a global basis. Consilient’s concept is simple, but the implications are transformational. We are the first company to apply federated AI (or federated learning) to help discover financial crime risk dynamically, collaboratively and more effectively across data sets, institutions, sectors and borders — without ever having to move, extract, or aggregate data.

This changes the paradigm for the management of illicit finance risks and fraud — moving to “insight sharing” through the sharing of models, as opposed to classic movement of data to share information; allowing data to reside and remain secure in situ, as opposed to trying to move or aggregate data into data lakes or secure enclaves; using behavioral analytics to discover unseen risk, as opposed to rules-based systems that result in 98 percent false positives in bank systems; allowing for collaboration between institutions and even between regulators and the private sector, as opposed to relying on slow, reactive ways to share information.

GCW: What results are you seeing with your customers and what’s your outlook for market expansion?

Zarate: What we are seeing with our clients is greater efficiency (massive reduction of false positives), effectiveness (discovery of unseen risk), and the ability to use Consilient’s exchange and federated learning and models to interrogate new data sets in ways impossible prior. This becomes all the more important as we have to discover more complex economic security risks in the environment — across regulatory regimes, institutions and borders — and with more and more payment disintermediation. The national economic security landscape is changing rapidly, and data will continue to be harder to move or access due to data privacy, security and sovereignty issues. Consilient’s platform, exchange and library of traveling models solves these issues by enabling dynamic risk management while preserving data privacy and security.

We are expanding Consilient’s work with financial institutions globally and are in discussions with regulators, Central Banks, and Financial Intelligence Units around the world to deploy Consilient as a tool of systemic risk discovery, regulatory oversight, and even audit. Consilient allows us to imagine an environment where different institutions, sectors and even government agencies are able to share insights dynamically to discover problematic or illicit behaviors in financial and commercial payments and transactions. This is game-changing at a time when companies and governments are looking for greater efficiencies and creative, safe ways to deploy AI.”

2025 Financial Crime Report: APAC Edition - Kroll,"With geopolitical uncertainty front of mind, rapidly advancing technology development, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI), the events of the past year have only amplified the challenges of fighting financial crime in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region. Our latest research—based on a survey of executives across the region—can help leaders prepare for what’s next.

Cybersecurity and the use of AI and cryptocurrencies by criminals are seen as key areas of financial crime risk for 2025 across the five APAC countries surveyed. While there was some variation in the level of comfort in the effectiveness of organizations’ compliance programs to address these risks, most executives have concerns about the sufficiency of technology and investment.

Kroll's Financial Crime Report 2025: APAC Edition does a deep dive into trends and findings from senior executives across India, Australia, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong conducted in Q4 2024.

Oracle Brings AI Agents to the Fight Against Financial Crime - PR Newswire,"New agentic AI capabilities in Oracle Investigation Hub can reduce manual work to help uncover and thwart financial schemes faster

AUSTIN, Texas, March 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Oracle Financial Services is supercharging its Investigation Hub Cloud Service with the addition of a broad class of AI agents and agentic workflows that enable financial firms to automate investigative processes needed to uncover complex patterns and fight financial crime. The agents help improve the overall quality and speed of reviewing suspicious activity by using generative AI-driven narratives to supplement investigators' own analysis. This can save valuable time and resources by offloading many traditionally manual tasks and enabling investigators to focus their time on the most pressing leads. These new capabilities are available globally for financial institutions of all sizes using the Investigation Hub crime and case management solution.

""The addition of agentic AI capabilities to our Investigation Hub Cloud Service represents a paradigm shift in financial crime investigations,"" said Jason Somrak, head of financial crime product strategy, Oracle Financial Services. ""Our unique generative AI approach follows investigative plans, collects evidence, and recommends actions while providing investigators with robust narratives documenting the findings. This enables firms to drive consistency in decision making and thoroughly investigate all risks automatically while realizing massive operational efficiencies.""

Combatting crime with agentic AI

Financial institutions face mounting pressure to identify and combat increasingly sophisticated financial crime schemes while managing regulatory scrutiny. Traditional investigative processes often rely on tedious manual data collection and analysis that can be slow, resource-intensive, and prone to human error.

While some solutions employ AI chatbots that require investigators to ask the right questions in the right way, Oracle Financial Services delivers multiple AI agents that are designed to surface key insights, collect evidence, recommend decisions, and generate comprehensive alert narratives. This automated approach helps eliminate inconsistencies caused by variations in user queries and helps deliver more consistent and reliable information for investigative analysts.

These agents, driven by generative AI, can be leveraged to analyze alert information, including matches between customer data and sanction lists. From there, they can be used to automatically create compelling narratives that summarize the key details of each alert, providing financial crime and compliance investigators with relevant information to better conduct a thorough analysis and make data-informed decisions.

These new capabilities are part of the larger set of Oracle financial crime and compliance management solutions focused on making financial investigations more predictable, reliable, and credible using generative AI.

A proactive and valuable FIU - Deloitte,"The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of a Subject Person (SP) is critical in enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the organisation’s response to financial crime (FC).

An FIU that is intelligence-led, tech-enabled and proactive has the power to identify, evaluate, and respond to threats faster and more effectively by putting actionable intelligence in the hands of those that can do something about it. It also has the potential to help the SP keep pace with evolving regulatory expectations around the effective application of the risk-based approach.

Within many SPs, the assessment of FC risk is still undertaken in silos. Data from different business areas and across domains is not brought together effectively for collective analysis and is not routinely enriched by external sources of intelligence. This inherently undermines the quality of analysis that can be conducted, and the outcomes delivered.

In addition, FIUs themselves are often ‘underpowered’, comprising only a small team of investigation analysts who are too often engaged in providing reactive support to law enforcement requests, over proactive intelligence and analysis. As a result, an SP’s ability to identify threats and respond to them proactively is undermined – as is the effectiveness and the efficiency of their response to FC.

How do you address this challenge?

In our view, the FIU needs to be multi-disciplined across fraud and FC risk domains with the following key responsibilities:

Identification – access to a holistic view of the customer to provide faster and more precise information to senior management, the business and law enforcement and to inform the identification of emerging and evolving threats. Analysis – development of comprehensive analysis of customer information to provide proactive intelligence to safeguard customers, the organisation and enhance controls. Advanced analytics skills will be applied, such as behavioural customer profiling. Dissemination – production of both tactical and strategic intelligence that is quickly actionable, both internally and externally.

For this model to be successfully deployed, the FIU must have access to:

A comprehensive view of all customer data (made available through the convergence of monitoring across customer behaviour and risk domains, dynamic customer lifecycle management and intelligence-led risk assessments), enriched with Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), and access to intelligence from intelligence sharing partnerships with other public and private sector stakeholders in the ecosystem.

Technologies that enable enriched customer data to be visualised, analysed, assessed, and actioned. Increased adoption and integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) solutions will also be of benefit by reducing manual effort and enabling trends to be spotted which might not be visible to the eye when dealing with lots of data.

FIU analysts who lead complex investigations but are also data literate to enable a greater understanding of how data can be manipulated and be able to query increasingly larger datasets.

In addition, it will be critical that the FIU has effective engagement with policymakers to secure permissions to embrace reformed ways of working.

Intra-bank sharing of information is critical, across its various entities, cross border, and via appropriate gateways. Information should also be available for analysis across risk domains, in particular, bringing together FC, fraud and cyber security data, which is still often addressed within silos in FIs. Other than the connection of fraudulent activity producing illicit funds that need to be laundered, it is often the same criminal actors perpetrating these crimes and they do not stick to one type, meaning collaboration amongst specialists in these areas would be valuable in an attempt to outsmart criminals. Often within global organisations, regulations restrict such sharing of information across jurisdictions, therefore this model will require internal and external governance arrangements to ensure data privacy regulatory and legal requirements are met.

Similarly, inter-bank and public-private partnerships are critical for enriching intelligence and harmonising the ecosystem of actors who are fighting FC. With a number of information sharing initiatives already in flight, such as: Article 75 of the new European Union Anti-Money Laundering Regulations1, the UK’s National Economic Crime Centre (NECC) led Fusion Pilot2; Transaction Monitoring Netherlands (TMNL); and, Collaborative Sharing of Money Laundering/Terrorism Financing Information & Cases (COSMIC) in Singapore bringing in new powers for information sharing; the FIU of the future is likely to have access to a much more diverse intelligence.

We recognise that what we describe represents a significant change from the model that currently exists in many banks and bank FIUs, and would require, in some cases, substantial re-structuring. However, we think these changes are valuable and suggest prioritising:

People – transitioning to multi-disciplined intelligence leads with expertise across several risk domains, and a clear distinction between investigative and proactive intelligence roles to ensure intelligence analysts are given the time and capacity to work on proactive intelligence without getting inundated with reactive investigations. In addition, more broadly within the FIU team, there is a need for resources with data-oriented backgrounds.

– transitioning to multi-disciplined intelligence leads with expertise across several risk domains, and a clear distinction between investigative and proactive intelligence roles to ensure intelligence analysts are given the time and capacity to work on proactive intelligence without getting inundated with reactive investigations. In addition, more broadly within the FIU team, there is a need for resources with data-oriented backgrounds. Process – production of authoritative intelligence to drive effective risk management across all domains. This will include an increased focus on ‘top-down’ thematic-based investigations, with effective outcome feedback-loops into risk/threat assessments and front-line FC controls.

Technology – investment in data, technologies, and partnerships to enable the creation and analysis of holistic customer views.

Alongside this, governance processes will need to be adapted both within the FIU and across the first and second lines of defence FC teams. Similarly, FC teams will need to put the required data and technology, processes, and procedures in place to harness and effectively exploit the outputs from the FIU across the organisation.

The outcome of these changes will have potential benefits across the entire organisation. SPs will be able to make better assessments of customer risk through holistic analysis. Targeted intelligence will help more effective detection of illicit activities, as well as driving efficiencies in the control framework. These improvements in efficiency and effectiveness will in turn lead to:

Better customer service (safeguarding customers through a reduction in fraud and FC exploitation);

Enhanced reputation with regulators and policy makers;

Enhanced quality of intelligence reporting; and

Improved time and cost efficiencies.

Criminals are often ahead of law enforcement and the controls that SPs put in place; they are aware of loopholes within the system and are opportunistic in exploiting them. Banks have a role to play, both in terms of meeting regulatory requirements, and being active in helping the system as a whole to better tackle FC. The existing system has a number of inadequacies that FIUs are well-placed to help address by taking a leading role in utilising technology, leveraging all accessible data in an analytical manner and actively participating in information sharing initiatives.

“Financial Crime Operations”... but not as we know it! | Future of Financial Crime - Deloitte,"The Maltese Anti-Money Laundering Act was adopted in 1994, with the Regulations coming into force in 2018. Since then, we have seen the scale and scope of regulatory expectations continue to expand and escalate, obliging regulated firms to respond through ongoing development of their compliance capabilities.

For many subject persons (SPs), the focus has been on regulatory compliance – attempting to do enough to stay out of the regulator’s gaze. However, where even this limited goal has been achieved with some measure of success, it has often been at the expense of operating efficiency.

Despite the long-held promise of technology – to enable smarter, more targeted controls and reduced operational effort – the reality is that the anti-financial crime capabilities of many organisations have not kept pace with either a rapidly evolving threat landscape or increasing regulatory expectations.

As a result, we have seen a never-ending expansion of manually intensive operational teams to process those activities intended to manage financial crime (FC) risk and ensure compliance. For some SPs, this has included building operations teams offshore in a move to manage spiralling costs. Quite simply, this cost burden is undesirable and unsustainable for many SPs.

Key challenges facing financial crime operations

Beyond simple measures of scale and cost, FC operations are typically plagued by a number of challenges to effective delivery:

Legacy technology - where SPs battle significant data deficiencies and analysts navigate multiple systems that don’t speak with each other;

Repetitive, clumsy customer interactions - where ineffective communications lead to a lack of engagement;

A struggle to attract and retain talent - where high staff turnover leads to a loss of corporate knowledge and the need for repeated training cycles; and

Lack of capacity to absorb inevitable incidents and surges – where SPs become repeatedly struggle to meet regulatory expectations and get stuck in a cycle of remediation.

But with a new generation of emerging and rapidly maturing technology capabilities, could we be on the threshold of a revolution in the way we operationally manage and execute FC compliance obligations? What will FC operations functions look like in the future? And what does this mean for people and the skills they will need?

What’s changing?

In previous blogs in the series, we have looked at some of the upstream shifts we see as critical to a future FC function – taking an intelligence-led, proactive approach to risk management, consolidating relevant internal and external data, connecting FC and monitoring capabilities, and encouraging self-service through digital-first customer journeys.

These shifts will play through into FC operations, leading to a more accurate understanding of customer risk and a reduced volume of higher quality investigations.

In parallel, Gen AI-powered solutions, better technology integration and enhanced use of data will transform the manually intensive operations processes we see today. FIs will need to explore and assess where the greatest impact may be on their operations, cognisant of the associated risks and delivery challenges, not least given the technology and data issues identified above. Objectives may include:

Minimising manual data gathering efforts from internal and external sources;

Intelligent analysis and risk identification;

Improving consistency and quality of outcomes; and

Enhancing feedback loops to monitoring and risk identification.

Collectively, such capabilities will support more efficient investigation and resolution processes, enable resources to focus on the highest and most complex risks, and create better outcomes for both customers and compliance.

What might the future look like

As FC operations become more interconnected, there will be a fundamental shift towards smaller teams with an enhanced skillset and broader capability to assess risks more holistically.

The automation of basic tasks will free up resources, removing duplication and complexity, while low value tasks which are unsuitable for automation will be outsourced. The residual teams will use a more technical skillset and expertise to make better informed risk management decisions.

With a smaller number of more highly skilled individuals, we will see different organisational structures. The factory model will become obsolete; and instead of separate isolated teams working on part of a process, analysts will operate in integrated teams, assessing different types of FC risks across the whole of the customer lifecycle.

Looking ahead, technology- and data-enabled transformation of operations and processes will be a critical priority, and a more desirable approach over offshoring all or parts of the operations function. However, given the capital investment required, we may see further growth in outsourcing FC operations rather than firms looking to develop their own next-generation FC operations capabilities. For the residual operations teams, we will see more engaging, skilled analytical work, delivering better and more sustainable risk outcomes and helping to attract and retain talent more effectively.",2025-04-02T07:00:00,https://www.deloitte.com/mt/en/services/consulting-financial/blogs/financial-crime-operations.html,"“Financial Crime Operations”... but not as we know it! | Future of Financial Crime - Deloitte The Maltese Anti-Money Laundering Act was adopted in 1994, with the Regulations coming into force in 2018.

These shifts will play through into FC operations, leading to a more accurate understanding of customer risk and a reduced volume of higher quality investigations.

In parallel, Gen AI-powered solutions, better technology integration and enhanced use of data will transform the manually intensive operations processes we see today. FIs will need to explore and assess where the greatest impact may be on their operations, cognisant of the associated risks and delivery challenges, not least given the technology and data issues identified above. Objectives may include:

Minimising manual data gathering efforts from internal and external sources;

Intelligent analysis and risk identification;

Improving consistency and quality of outcomes; and

Enhancing feedback loops to monitoring and risk identification.

Collectively, such capabilities will support more efficient investigation and resolution processes, enable resources to focus on the highest and most complex risks, and create better outcomes for both customers and compliance.

What might the future look like

As FC operations become more interconnected, there will be a fundamental shift towards smaller teams with an enhanced skillset and broader capability to assess risks more holistically.

The automation of basic tasks will free up resources, removing duplication and complexity, while low value tasks which are unsuitable for automation will be outsourced. The residual teams will use a more technical skillset and expertise to make better informed risk management decisions.

With a smaller number of more highly skilled individuals, we will see different organisational structures. The factory model will become obsolete; and instead of separate isolated teams working on part of a process, analysts will operate in integrated teams, assessing different types of FC risks across the whole of the customer lifecycle.

Looking ahead, technology- and data-enabled transformation of operations and processes will be a critical priority, and a more desirable approach over offshoring all or parts of the operations function. However, given the capital investment required, we may see further growth in outsourcing FC operations rather than firms looking to develop their own next-generation FC operations capabilities. For the residual operations teams, we will see more engaging, skilled analytical work, delivering better and more sustainable risk outcomes and helping to attract and retain talent more effectively.",['Money Laundering'],0.2

Over 70% of Hong Kong executives expect increase in cybercrime in 2025: Kroll - South China Morning Post,"More than 70 per cent of executives in Hong Kong expect an increase in financial crime in 2025, while only 18 per cent believe their organisation’s compliance programme is “very effective”, according a report from Kroll, a financial and risk advisory firm.

The report, released Monday, surveyed more than 600 respondents worldwide between September and October 2024. Half worked in the financial services sector , while the rest came from other regulated industries, including accounting, insurance and real estate

Geopolitics and technology – including artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency – are two themes that set the latest report apart from those in the past, said Violet Ho, Kroll’s head of Greater China investigations, diligence and compliance.

“By and large, we’re seeing generally somewhat pessimistic views from the survey respondents,” Ho said. “The overall sentiment is that we are living in a very volatile environment right now.”

The main concern behind the pessimistic sentiment is cybercrime, Ho said. Hong Kong is a fast-paced financial hub, which makes it a frequent transit point for global fraud, she added.

“That is almost a by-product of being a financial centre, but it also puts the pressure on financial institutions and banks in Hong Kong to be more stringent in terms of their [know your customer] procedures, anti-money-laundering protection mechanisms and procedures,” she said.

Europe's Pivotal Role in Safeguarding Global Financial Stability and Fighting Financial Crime - Nasdaq,"European financial systems are confronting a $750 billion challenge that reveals the complex linkages between innovation, regulation, and criminal adaptability.

In a landmark report released this week, Nasdaq Verafin illuminates how the unprecedented complexity of modern financial networks helps to fuel global financial crime.

The Special Edition of the 2024 Global Financial Crime Report, Financial Crime Insights: Europe, offers a fresh, Europe-centric analysis, enriched with insights from anti-financial crime professionals across the region.

The report estimates that of the $3.1 trillion in illicit funds that flowed through the international financial system in 2023, Europe represents nearly a quarter of this massive economic challenge.

It also calls for European financial institutions to embrace collaboration and technology to fight financial crime, highlighting the unique opportunity for Europe to cement its position as a leader in financial crime prevention.

A Landscape of Complexity

The modern financial ecosystem is a web of remarkable intricacy. Rapid technological advancements, globalization, and increasingly sophisticated digital transactions have created a landscape that is simultaneously more connected and more vulnerable than ever before.

Today, criminals exploit new tools, tactics, and technologies to commit fraud, move money, and fund illicit activities, leveraging financial system complexities to evade detection.

This may take place in Europe, but the impact is global. “Criminals aren't bound by rules or borders or regulations, and so, there's no boundaries when it comes to criminal activity,” said Stephanie Champion, Head of Nasdaq Verafin. “European banks and financial institutions are currently working together and investing in fighting financial crime and Nasdaq’s new report illuminates the scale of this challenge.”

In 2023, $750 billion in illicit funds flowed through Europe’s financial system, equivalent to 2.3% of the continent's GDP. Meanwhile, scams and bank fraud totaled more than $100 billion in losses. Additionally, $195 billion in illicit flows moved across Europe’s borders, representing 26% of all money laundering activity in the region. “What we've learned, and what we continue to see, is that the financial industry is intrinsically connected,” said Champion. “What's happening in one jurisdiction is relevant to the other jurisdiction because of the interconnected nature of the financial system.”

Harnessing Technology to Safeguard the Integrity of the Financial System

As Nasdaq and Boston Consulting Group’s 2025 Complexity Report highlights, rapidly evolving financial crime threats interact with equally dynamic regulatory expectations. Banks are increasingly active innovators, constantly adapting to a complex, sophisticated threat landscape.

As the financial sector works to stay ahead of criminal networks, artificial intelligence is emerging as a powerful ally. A remarkable 74% of anti-financial crime professionals are proactively planning to increase spending on AI and machine learning in the next two years, with 83% exploring generative AI use cases.

For one example of AI in practice, Nasdaq Verafin has developed AI-powered tools that can automate daily compliance tasks, enabling organizations to concentrate on investigating serious criminal activities like human trafficking and drug trafficking.

“That allows our customers to really focus on targeted typologies and real underlying crime that has true human impact,” Champion explained, adding that this transforms compliance from a time-consuming checkbox exercise into a dynamic, risk-based process.

Fostering Collaboration to Break Down Institutional Barriers

The new report also reveals a promising insight into how financial institutions approach crime prevention.

“What we certainly experienced in our customer base is that they really put their differences aside with respect to being competitors,” Champion said. “They know that this problem can only be solved if we work together.”

Champion said she is also seeing a growing alignment between the public and private sectors on common goals and the prioritization of financial crime prevention—including regulatory changes that cut through complexity and strengthen financial institutions’ ability to share information.

In particular, the European Union's latest Anti-Money Laundering package includes an article specifically aimed at facilitating information sharing across sectors and across borders.

“We see a tremendous amount of momentum in these areas across Europe,” Champion said, adding that the continent now stands at a defining moment. Tackling the $3.1 trillion global illicit funds challenge calls for a unified approach, she said—one that blends cutting-edge technology, regulatory agility, and seamless collaboration.

Champion is confident that the region is up to the challenge. “We can do that through technology, through regulation, connecting banks together, through private-public partnerships. So we're in an ecosystem that really allows banks to work together in the fight against financial crime.”

Olukoyede Challenges Commonwealth Nations to Emulate Nigeria in Fight against Financial Crimes - Economic and Financial Crimes Commission - EFCC,"Olukoyede Challenges Commonwealth Nations to Emulate Nigeria in Fight against Financial Crimes

Executive Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Mr. Ola Olukoyede has challenged Commonwealth Nations to learn from Nigeria’s proactive reforms and collaborative approaches in its fight against corruption to strengthen their defences against financial crimes.

He threw this challenge on Monday, April 7, 2025 at the opening of a five-day Commonwealth Law Conference organised by the Commonwealth Lawyers Association , CLA, in Malta, with the theme: Combating Transnational organised Crime in the Commonwealth: Opportunities and Challenges.

Olukoyede who spoke on the topic: ""Combating Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation Financing: Has FATF Enhanced Monitoring Made any Difference in Non-Compliant Countries?"", said the Financial Action Task Force's, FATF’s enhanced monitoring framework, while presenting significant challenges, also offers a clear roadmap for reforms.

According to him, Nigeria’s experience reinforces the fact that the benefits of monitoring extend beyond mere compliance but the creation of a resilient financial system capable of disrupting the financing of terrorism and proliferation activities.

In his advice to the Commonwealth Nations, the EFCC boss said that while the FATF has made major changes to the criteria for putting countries on its lists to relieve pressures on least developed countries and focus on those countries posing greater risks to the international financial system, ""members of the Commonwealth should continue to push for more considerations for countries in the Sub-Saharan who continued to constitute the highest number on countries on the enhanced monitoring list"".

He pointed out that Nigeria has largely addressed all its action items under the enhanced monitoring process with exception of the items under Immediate Outcome 8 (Confiscation and highlighted lessons for other Commonwealth Countries.

Such lessons include, high level political commitment, proactive compliance over reactive measures, building enforcement capacity, harnessing Technology, fostering public-private partnerships and continuous international engagement.

Held biennially, the Commonwealth Law Conference is a prestigious event in the legal calendar, attracting senior justice leaders, academics and practicing lawyers from around the 56 member Commonwealth Nations.

The Association exists to maintain and promote the rule of law throughout the Commonwealth by ensuring that an independent and efficient legal profession, with the highest standards of ethics and integrity, serves the people of the Commonwealth.

Among other speakers at the event were: Juliet Ibekaku- Nwagwu, founder, Africa Centre for Governance, Asset Recovery and Sustainable Development; Richard Salter KC, Barrister 3 Vericulam Building, London and Loretta Joseph , Senior Policy Adviser and Consultant to the Commonwealth Secretariat on Virtual Asset Model Law.

Cyprus receives FBI report on measures to tackle financial crime and sanctions evasion - Newsday,"NICOSIA, Cyprus — Cyprus said Thursday its will adopt recommendations of a security initiative with the United States to fight money laundering, sanctions evasion and other financial crimes during which a team from FBI was seconded to the Mediterranean island nation for nine months.

The FBI helped train Cypriot police in identifying and prosecuting cases of illegal financing and attempts to evade U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions imposed on any third country.

The U.S. team has also produced a detailed report outlining specific recommendations and proposals including additional staff training, upgrading high-tech systems and amending existing legislation, Cyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis told The Associated Press.

He said Cypriot law enforcement authorities are currently looking to put into use the recommendations to bolster their effectiveness.

The joint initiative was set up under the Biden administration after Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides in 2023 invited FBI and Justice Department officials to assist with investigations into allegations that Cypriot financial service providers had helped Russian oligarchs skirt international sanctions.

Since then, the Trump administration has disbanding the Biden-era Task Force KleptoCapture program which was aimed at seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs.

Christodoulides has pledged to clean up Cyprus's reputation as a money laundering and sanctions-evasion hub. As part of those efforts, Cypriot law enforcement agencies received training on financial investigative and forensic accounting techniques both locally and at the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest, Hungary, according to a Cyprus-U.S. joint statement issued last year.

BBC New gaming licence applications on the island will be subject to ""heightened scrutiny""

The Manx government is set to bolster its defences against ""evolving"" threats to the island's financial and online gambling industries by international criminals. A spokeswoman said online gaming and gambling platforms were at the centre of an ""increasingly complex and sophisticated criminal landscape in east and south-east Asia"". Some of the Gambling Supervision Commission's (GSC) processes are set to be strengthened and new gaming licence applications will be subject to more scrutiny. Deputy Chief Minister Jane Poole-Wilson said the government would ""not hesitate to act to disrupt and prosecute"" anyone using the island for criminal activity.

She said ""illicit actions by transnational organised criminals to exploit the island's business environment and immigration security"" were taken ""extremely seriously"" by the government and Manx authorities. In a statement, a spokeswoman said the risks presented by overseas criminal networks were now affecting jurisdictions worldwide and ""increasing vigilance"" was needed when conducting business linked to the region. As an international financial centre with links to the UK, the Isle of Man is ""attractive for exploitation"" by organised crime groups, she said.

"Africa loses $88.6bn to corruption annually, says ECOWAS - Punch Newspapers","The Economic Community of West African States has identified corruption and financial crimes as major obstacles to the region’s economic and social development, calling for stronger institutional capacity to combat the growing threat.

Speaking on Monday at the opening of a five-day Regional Certification Training on Financial Investigation for Anti-Corruption Institutions in West Africa in Abuja, the ECOWAS Commissioner for Political Affairs, Abdel-Fatau Musah, said that despite democratic progress, corruption remains a significant threat to governance and development in many member states.

Citing a research report, Musah, who was represented by the Commission’s Head of the Democracy and Good Governance Division, Ebenezer Asiedu, said Africa loses $88.6 billion annually to corruption and illicit financial crimes.

He added that this amounts to 3.7 percent of the continent’s GDP.

Musah said, “In spite of the progress, democracy in most of our member states faces fragility, particularly due to the menace of corruption. For instance, research indicates that Africa loses a staggering $88.6 billion annually due to corruption and Illicit Financial Flows, which takes up 3.7% of our continent’s GDP.

“Indeed, corruption and financial crime are among the biggest obstacles to economic and social development in West Africa and around the world.”

He said the adoption of crypto-currencies and other digital financial systems have introduced new risks across the region.

Musah said, “As the financial industry experiences growth in West Africa, the increasing adoption of crypto-currencies and other emerging forms of online financial systems have introduced new risks and vulnerabilities across member states, underscoring the need for Anti-corruption institutions to develop specialized skills and knowledge to effectively combat these crimes.”

He explained that the training, organised by ECOWAS in collaboration with the Network of Anti-Corruption Institutions in West Africa and Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, aims to equip investigators with advanced techniques for tackling increasingly sophisticated financial crimes.

“As we work toward realizing the ECOWAS Vision 2050, addressing corruption and Illicit Financial Flows is essential to achieving sustainable development and regional stability,” Musah said.

In his remarks, the EFCC Chairman, Ola Olukoyede, said the transnational nature of financial crimes are transnational in nature, noting the need for regional cooperation in combating threats such as money laundering and terrorism financing.

“The threats we face are sophisticated, tech-enabled, and deeply embedded within political and economic structures.

“To effectively confront these challenges, we must share intelligence, harmonize our methods, and speak with one voice,” he added.",2025-04-08T04:04:54,https://punchng.com/africa-loses-88-6bn-to-corruption-annually-says-ecowas/,"Africa loses $88.6bn to corruption annually, says ECOWAS - Punch Newspapers The Economic Community of West African States has identified corruption and financial crimes as major obstacles to the region’s economic and social development, calling for stronger institutional capacity to combat the growing threat.

Business leaders told to do this one thing before it's too late - City AM,"Major Companies House change launched as business leaders called to action

A major change to Companies House has been launched.

Business leaders can now verify their identity on Companies House as part of a major drive designed to slash economic crime.

As of today, 8 April, directors can voluntarily verify their identity before it becomes a legal requirement later this year.

More than six million individuals will need to comply in the 12 months after identity verification becomes compulsory.

In a statement, Companies House said the phased approach “reduces the burden” on businesses.

Business leaders can now verify their identity directly with Companies House through GOV.UK One Login or through an Authorised Corporate Service Provider (ACSP).

The move forms one of the changes to UK company law under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023.

The legislation gave Companies House new and enhanced powers “to help disrupt economic crime and support economic growth”.

Companies House said the change will “provide more assurance about who is setting up, running, owning and controlling companies in the UK”.

Last March, Companies House launched an “urgent review” after the government-owned corporate register saw one account file 800 “erroneous” forms on 190 companies, raising fears over a sophisticated fraud targeted at banks.

Banking trade body UK Finance issued an “urgent” notice to its members regarding hundreds of “erroneous” filings made at Companies House towards the end of last month.

The warning concerned roughly 800 forms on 190 companies related to the discharging of financial liabilities that were not submitted by the relevant financial firm or its client business.

Companies House change to become mandatory in the autumn

Companies House CEO Louise Smyth CBE said: “Identity verification will play a key role in improving the quality and reliability of our data and tackling misuse of the companies register.

“To save time later, we encourage directors, people with significant control of companies (PSCs) and those filing information with Companies House to verify their identity during the voluntary window.

“We expect identity verification to become mandatory from autumn 2025.

“To reduce the burden on business, the IDV requirement for existing directors will be integrated into the annual confirmation statement update process.”

‘Economic crime has become too common’

Minister for employment rights, competition and markets Justin Madders MP added: “In a time where economic crime has become too common, it is imperative that we bring in measures to prevent identities being stolen online and today marks a significant milestone in our plans to require identity verification for those setting up and running companies on the Companies House register later this year.

“This is good for business, lenders and transparency and will give companies, consumers and lenders more certainty about who they are doing business with.”

The legislation will bring in some of the biggest reforms to Companies House since it was set up in 1844.
