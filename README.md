Develop a system to automatically screen publicly available news articles and identify entities (individuals or corporations) potentially involved in financial crime, scandals, or sanctions. This information will be used to enhance the bank's internal financial crime detection and prevention programs. The system should be able to identify and extract relevant entities from news articles, classify the nature of adverse news, and provide a confidence score for the relevance of the news to financial crime.
