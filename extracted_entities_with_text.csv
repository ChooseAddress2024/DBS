2025 Financial Crime Report - Kroll,"Executive Summary

By David Lewis and Thomas Bock

With AI-powered cybercrime disrupting businesses across industries and regulators imposing billion-dollar penalties for compliance failures, more than 70% of executives expect financial crime risk to increase in 2025—compared to 67% in 2023—yet only 23% believe their organization’s compliance program is “very effective” in combating it.

These are among the key takeaways from Kroll’s 2025 Financial Crime Report, which surveyed over 600 business leaders in the U.S., the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. Respondents included CEOs, chief compliance officers, general counsel, and chief risk officers from leading financial services, accounting, insurance and legal services firms.

In addition to assessing financial crime expectations, concerns and readiness for the year ahead, the report examines how AI can fight—or enable—illicit activity and captures current sentiment around geopolitical threats, evolving regulations, supply chain risks and more.",2025-03-18T07:00:00,"['David Lewis', 'Thomas Bock']","['Kroll’s 2025', 'Financial Crime Report']",https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/financial-crime-report-2025
Oracle Brings AI Agents to the Fight Against Financial Crime - Oracle,"Oracle Financial Services is supercharging its Investigation Hub Cloud Service with the addition of a broad class of AI agents and agentic workflows that enable financial firms to automate investigative processes needed to uncover complex patterns and fight financial crime. The agents help improve the overall quality and speed of reviewing suspicious activity by using generative AI-driven narratives to supplement investigators’ own analysis. This can save valuable time and resources by offloading many traditionally manual tasks and enabling investigators to focus their time on the most pressing leads. These new capabilities are available globally for financial institutions of all sizes using the Investigation Hub crime and case management solution.

“The addition of agentic AI capabilities to our Investigation Hub Cloud Service represents a paradigm shift in financial crime investigations,” said Jason Somrak, head of financial crime product strategy, Oracle Financial Services. “Our unique generative AI approach follows investigative plans, collects evidence, and recommends actions while providing investigators with robust narratives documenting the findings. This enables firms to drive consistency in decision making and thoroughly investigate all risks automatically while realizing massive operational efficiencies.”

Combatting crime with agentic AI

Financial institutions face mounting pressure to identify and combat increasingly sophisticated financial crime schemes while managing regulatory scrutiny. Traditional investigative processes often rely on tedious manual data collection and analysis that can be slow, resource-intensive, and prone to human error.

While some solutions employ AI chatbots that require investigators to ask the right questions in the right way, Oracle Financial Services delivers multiple AI agents that are designed to surface key insights, collect evidence, recommend decisions, and generate comprehensive alert narratives. This automated approach helps eliminate inconsistencies caused by variations in user queries and helps deliver more consistent and reliable information for investigative analysts.

These agents, driven by generative AI, can be leveraged to analyze alert information, including matches between customer data and sanction lists. From there, they can be used to automatically create compelling narratives that summarize the key details of each alert, providing financial crime and compliance investigators with relevant information to better conduct a thorough analysis and make data-informed decisions.

These new capabilities are part of the larger set of Oracle financial crime and compliance management solutions focused on making financial investigations more predictable, reliable, and credible using generative AI.

NICE Actimize Adds Agentic AI to Financial Crime Prevention Platform - PYMNTS.com,"NICE Actimize added agentic AI capabilities to X-Sight ActOne, the company’s platform for fraud and financial crime prevention.

Available through X-Sight ActOne’s InvestigateAI, the agentic AI capabilities orchestrate all fraud and financial crime prevention workflows on one platform, automate processes and engage human oversight only when necessary, the company said in a Wednesday (April 2) press release.

“This empowers financial institutions to scale operations and realize transformative cost and labor efficiencies,” NICE Actimize CEO Craig Costigan said in the release.

The agentic AI can autonomously craft an investigation plan based on a financial institution’s policy and procedures, understand the context of an investigation and execute upon the plan, and inject real-time data, according to the release.

It can also learn to become more effective with use, be trained to act upon many tasks, reverse prompt to engage humans when necessary, and provide explainability of its AI insights and actions so that there is full transparency and confidence for analysts and auditors, per the release.

“Equipped with AI and advanced analytics, the platform delivers outcomes and empowers investigators with the intelligence required for swift, accurate and efficient investigations,” the release said.

AI is arming companies to supercharge their defensive capabilities in terms of risk management, since trust and security are the foundation of financial transactions, PYMNTS reported March 19.

Meanwhile, Coupa added agentic AI features to its spend management platform in February, saying the offerings include a contract intelligence tool that improves contract language analysis and processes more contracts with standard and custom field extraction.

“Agentic AI will play a central role in making our collaborative global trade network grow,” Coupa Chief Product and Technology Officer Salvatore Lombardo said at the time in a press release.

During the same month, Routable enhanced its accounts payable automation platform by adding an AI agent that can detect invoice fraud and human error.

The AI agent scans invoices for anomalies and errors and, if it finds anything questionable, alerts AP teams to prevent fraud and error before it happens.

“AI has the power to help you do something humans can’t do, something previously impossible,” Routable CEO and co-founder Omri Mor said at the time in a press release.

Senators re-up bill to expand Secret Service’s financial cybercrime authorities - CyberScoop,"A bipartisan pair of senators is taking another shot at their bill to expand the U.S. Secret Service’s investigative powers for financial cybercrime probes.

The Combatting Money Laundering in Cyber Crime Act from Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, would update federal law to strengthen the Secret Service’s authority, enabling the agency to look into criminal activity tied to digital assets.

“Dangerous criminals are constantly changing their tactics and using new technology to avoid detection,” Cortez Masto said in a statement. “Our law enforcement agencies need to adapt to keep communities safe. I will continue to fight to pass this bipartisan legislation that would help the Secret Service more effectively combat cybercrime.”

Under current law, the Secret Service is empowered to investigate cybercrimes that threaten national security, but those that are conducted via unlicensed money transmitting businesses fall outside the agency’s purview.

The legislation from Cortez Masto and Grassley, both members of the Senate Finance Committee, addresses that gap by allowing Secret Service members to probe digital asset transactions tied to transnational cyber criminal activity.

“As money laundering schemes continue to evolve, so must our capacity to combat them,” Grassley said in a statement. “By enhancing Secret Service’s authority to investigate criminal digital assets, our bill significantly improves law enforcement’s ability to effectively anticipate, identify and prevent cybercrime.”

Cortez Masto and Grassley first introduced this bill last July, but the legislation didn’t make it out of committee. The Nevada Democrat told CyberScoop at the time that “the funding of criminal activity through digital assets poses a direct threat to the security and safety of our nation.”

The Secret Service’s history with combatting cybercrime dates back to 2004 and the launch of its internal Cyber Investigative Section, one of the U.S. government’s first units dedicated to cybercrime.

Five years ago, the agency created its Cyber Fraud Task Forces. Since then, there’s been a steady drumbeat from current and former federal cyber officials calling for the Secret Service, FBI and Treasury Department to invest in the hiring of agents with cyber skills to pursue financial investigations.

In January 2024, the Secret Service said it would relaunch its Cyber Investigations Advisory Board, a 16-member body tasked with overhauling financial cybercrime investigative practices at the agency.

The Department of Justice and Treasury Department have warned in recent years about the increasing frequency with which digital assets are being used in ransomware attacks, fraud schemes, money laundering and other crimes.

Cortez Masto has had a particular focus on cybercrime and cryptocurrency, co-sponsoring the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act and helping to get the FinCEN Improvement Act — which strengthened the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s powers — passed and signed into law.",2025-04-04T19:03:28,"['Grassley', 'Chuck Grassley', 'Cortez Masto', 'Catherine Cortez Masto']","['the U.S. Secret Service’s', 'The Combatting Money Laundering', 'Cyber Investigations Advisory Board', 'the Secret Service’s', 'the Secret Service', 'The Department of Justice', 'the Senate Finance Committee', 'FBI', 'Cyber Investigative Section', 'the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s', 'Grassley', 'Secret Service', 'Treasury Department', 'The Secret Service’s', 'Secret Service’s', 'CyberScoop', 'Cyber Fraud Task Forces']",https://cyberscoop.com/secret-service-financial-cybercrimes-senate-bill/
Europe's Pivotal Role in Safeguarding Global Financial Stability and Fighting Financial Crime - Nasdaq,"European financial systems are confronting a $750 billion challenge that reveals the complex linkages between innovation, regulation, and criminal adaptability.

In a landmark report released this week, Nasdaq Verafin illuminates how the unprecedented complexity of modern financial networks helps to fuel global financial crime.

The Special Edition of the 2024 Global Financial Crime Report, Financial Crime Insights: Europe, offers a fresh, Europe-centric analysis, enriched with insights from anti-financial crime professionals across the region.

The report estimates that of the $3.1 trillion in illicit funds that flowed through the international financial system in 2023, Europe represents nearly a quarter of this massive economic challenge.

It also calls for European financial institutions to embrace collaboration and technology to fight financial crime, highlighting the unique opportunity for Europe to cement its position as a leader in financial crime prevention.

A Landscape of Complexity

The modern financial ecosystem is a web of remarkable intricacy. Rapid technological advancements, globalization, and increasingly sophisticated digital transactions have created a landscape that is simultaneously more connected and more vulnerable than ever before.

Today, criminals exploit new tools, tactics, and technologies to commit fraud, move money, and fund illicit activities, leveraging financial system complexities to evade detection.

This may take place in Europe, but the impact is global. “Criminals aren't bound by rules or borders or regulations, and so, there's no boundaries when it comes to criminal activity,” said Stephanie Champion, Head of Nasdaq Verafin. “European banks and financial institutions are currently working together and investing in fighting financial crime and Nasdaq’s new report illuminates the scale of this challenge.”

In 2023, $750 billion in illicit funds flowed through Europe’s financial system, equivalent to 2.3% of the continent's GDP. Meanwhile, scams and bank fraud totaled more than $100 billion in losses. Additionally, $195 billion in illicit flows moved across Europe’s borders, representing 26% of all money laundering activity in the region. “What we've learned, and what we continue to see, is that the financial industry is intrinsically connected,” said Champion. “What's happening in one jurisdiction is relevant to the other jurisdiction because of the interconnected nature of the financial system.”

Harnessing Technology to Safeguard the Integrity of the Financial System

As Nasdaq and Boston Consulting Group’s 2025 Complexity Report highlights, rapidly evolving financial crime threats interact with equally dynamic regulatory expectations. Banks are increasingly active innovators, constantly adapting to a complex, sophisticated threat landscape.

As the financial sector works to stay ahead of criminal networks, artificial intelligence is emerging as a powerful ally. A remarkable 74% of anti-financial crime professionals are proactively planning to increase spending on AI and machine learning in the next two years, with 83% exploring generative AI use cases.

For one example of AI in practice, Nasdaq Verafin has developed AI-powered tools that can automate daily compliance tasks, enabling organizations to concentrate on investigating serious criminal activities like human trafficking and drug trafficking.

“That allows our customers to really focus on targeted typologies and real underlying crime that has true human impact,” Champion explained, adding that this transforms compliance from a time-consuming checkbox exercise into a dynamic, risk-based process.

Fostering Collaboration to Break Down Institutional Barriers

The new report also reveals a promising insight into how financial institutions approach crime prevention.

“What we certainly experienced in our customer base is that they really put their differences aside with respect to being competitors,” Champion said. “They know that this problem can only be solved if we work together.”

Champion said she is also seeing a growing alignment between the public and private sectors on common goals and the prioritization of financial crime prevention—including regulatory changes that cut through complexity and strengthen financial institutions’ ability to share information.

In particular, the European Union's latest Anti-Money Laundering package includes an article specifically aimed at facilitating information sharing across sectors and across borders.

“We see a tremendous amount of momentum in these areas across Europe,” Champion said, adding that the continent now stands at a defining moment. Tackling the $3.1 trillion global illicit funds challenge calls for a unified approach, she said—one that blends cutting-edge technology, regulatory agility, and seamless collaboration.

Champion is confident that the region is up to the challenge. “We can do that through technology, through regulation, connecting banks together, through private-public partnerships. So we're in an ecosystem that really allows banks to work together in the fight against financial crime.”

A proactive and valuable FIU - Deloitte,"The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of a Subject Person (SP) is critical in enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the organisation’s response to financial crime (FC).

An FIU that is intelligence-led, tech-enabled and proactive has the power to identify, evaluate, and respond to threats faster and more effectively by putting actionable intelligence in the hands of those that can do something about it. It also has the potential to help the SP keep pace with evolving regulatory expectations around the effective application of the risk-based approach.

Within many SPs, the assessment of FC risk is still undertaken in silos. Data from different business areas and across domains is not brought together effectively for collective analysis and is not routinely enriched by external sources of intelligence. This inherently undermines the quality of analysis that can be conducted, and the outcomes delivered.

In addition, FIUs themselves are often ‘underpowered’, comprising only a small team of investigation analysts who are too often engaged in providing reactive support to law enforcement requests, over proactive intelligence and analysis. As a result, an SP’s ability to identify threats and respond to them proactively is undermined – as is the effectiveness and the efficiency of their response to FC.

How do you address this challenge?

In our view, the FIU needs to be multi-disciplined across fraud and FC risk domains with the following key responsibilities:

Identification – access to a holistic view of the customer to provide faster and more precise information to senior management, the business and law enforcement and to inform the identification of emerging and evolving threats. Analysis – development of comprehensive analysis of customer information to provide proactive intelligence to safeguard customers, the organisation and enhance controls. Advanced analytics skills will be applied, such as behavioural customer profiling. Dissemination – production of both tactical and strategic intelligence that is quickly actionable, both internally and externally.

For this model to be successfully deployed, the FIU must have access to:

A comprehensive view of all customer data (made available through the convergence of monitoring across customer behaviour and risk domains, dynamic customer lifecycle management and intelligence-led risk assessments), enriched with Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), and access to intelligence from intelligence sharing partnerships with other public and private sector stakeholders in the ecosystem.

Technologies that enable enriched customer data to be visualised, analysed, assessed, and actioned. Increased adoption and integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) solutions will also be of benefit by reducing manual effort and enabling trends to be spotted which might not be visible to the eye when dealing with lots of data.

FIU analysts who lead complex investigations but are also data literate to enable a greater understanding of how data can be manipulated and be able to query increasingly larger datasets.

In addition, it will be critical that the FIU has effective engagement with policymakers to secure permissions to embrace reformed ways of working.

Intra-bank sharing of information is critical, across its various entities, cross border, and via appropriate gateways. Information should also be available for analysis across risk domains, in particular, bringing together FC, fraud and cyber security data, which is still often addressed within silos in FIs. Other than the connection of fraudulent activity producing illicit funds that need to be laundered, it is often the same criminal actors perpetrating these crimes and they do not stick to one type, meaning collaboration amongst specialists in these areas would be valuable in an attempt to outsmart criminals. Often within global organisations, regulations restrict such sharing of information across jurisdictions, therefore this model will require internal and external governance arrangements to ensure data privacy regulatory and legal requirements are met.

Similarly, inter-bank and public-private partnerships are critical for enriching intelligence and harmonising the ecosystem of actors who are fighting FC. With a number of information sharing initiatives already in flight, such as: Article 75 of the new European Union Anti-Money Laundering Regulations1, the UK’s National Economic Crime Centre (NECC) led Fusion Pilot2; Transaction Monitoring Netherlands (TMNL); and, Collaborative Sharing of Money Laundering/Terrorism Financing Information & Cases (COSMIC) in Singapore bringing in new powers for information sharing; the FIU of the future is likely to have access to a much more diverse intelligence.

We recognise that what we describe represents a significant change from the model that currently exists in many banks and bank FIUs, and would require, in some cases, substantial re-structuring. However, we think these changes are valuable and suggest prioritising:

People – transitioning to multi-disciplined intelligence leads with expertise across several risk domains, and a clear distinction between investigative and proactive intelligence roles to ensure intelligence analysts are given the time and capacity to work on proactive intelligence without getting inundated with reactive investigations. In addition, more broadly within the FIU team, there is a need for resources with data-oriented backgrounds.

– transitioning to multi-disciplined intelligence leads with expertise across several risk domains, and a clear distinction between investigative and proactive intelligence roles to ensure intelligence analysts are given the time and capacity to work on proactive intelligence without getting inundated with reactive investigations. In addition, more broadly within the FIU team, there is a need for resources with data-oriented backgrounds. Process – production of authoritative intelligence to drive effective risk management across all domains. This will include an increased focus on ‘top-down’ thematic-based investigations, with effective outcome feedback-loops into risk/threat assessments and front-line FC controls.

Technology – investment in data, technologies, and partnerships to enable the creation and analysis of holistic customer views.

Alongside this, governance processes will need to be adapted both within the FIU and across the first and second lines of defence FC teams. Similarly, FC teams will need to put the required data and technology, processes, and procedures in place to harness and effectively exploit the outputs from the FIU across the organisation.

The outcome of these changes will have potential benefits across the entire organisation. SPs will be able to make better assessments of customer risk through holistic analysis. Targeted intelligence will help more effective detection of illicit activities, as well as driving efficiencies in the control framework. These improvements in efficiency and effectiveness will in turn lead to:

Better customer service (safeguarding customers through a reduction in fraud and FC exploitation);

Enhanced reputation with regulators and policy makers;

Enhanced quality of intelligence reporting; and

Improved time and cost efficiencies.

Criminals are often ahead of law enforcement and the controls that SPs put in place; they are aware of loopholes within the system and are opportunistic in exploiting them. Banks have a role to play, both in terms of meeting regulatory requirements, and being active in helping the system as a whole to better tackle FC. The existing system has a number of inadequacies that FIUs are well-placed to help address by taking a leading role in utilising technology, leveraging all accessible data in an analytical manner and actively participating in information sharing initiatives.

Chartis Ranks Quantifind #1 in the Financial Crimes and Compliance 50 Report for Dynamic Risk Typologies--Underscoring why 7 of the top 10 banks in the US choose Quantifind - PR Newswire,"PALO ALTO, Calif., March 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- In a time when financial crime is evolving at an unprecedented pace, Quantifind has been recognized as the #1 AI Risk Intelligence Provider in the 2025 Financial Crimes and Compliance 50 (FCC50) Report by Chartis Research. This distinction reinforces Quantifind's leadership in AI-driven financial crime risk intelligence, equipping financial institutions, governments, and corporations with the power to detect, assess, and mitigate emerging threats with unparalleled accuracy, speed, and scale.

The Convergence of Financial Crime Risks Requires Advanced Intelligence

The global financial crime landscape has grown more complex, with illicit actors leveraging new technologies and geopolitical instability to exploit vulnerabilities across banking, fintech, and supply chain networks. Operation Destabilise, a U.K.-led initiative, recently uncovered a money-laundering network linking Russian operatives, European drug cartels, and cryptocurrency exchanges used to evade sanctions—a clear demonstration of how traditional organized crime, state actors, and emerging financial technologies are increasingly interconnected (Financial Times, 2024).

The ability to assess risk dynamically across multiple typologies—spanning sanctions evasion, fraud, money laundering, and human trafficking—is now mission-critical for compliance teams. Without real-time, AI-powered intelligence, financial institutions risk being reactive rather than proactive, allowing threats to materialize before they can be stopped.

""Financial crime networks operate across industries, borders, and regulatory frameworks—and fighting them requires a united front, said Annalisa Camarillo, EVP of Marketing at Quantifind."" "" On March 25, we are hosting the Human Trafficking Convergence event with our partners Polaris and Deloitte, major financial institutions, and public sector partners to leverage our AI-powered risk typologies in the real world. This event is about more than discussion; it's about action—applying financial crime intelligence to expose hidden networks and stop illicit finance at its source.

Bank Secrecy Act Data Key to IRS-CI Cracking Many Financial Crime Cases - CPA Practice Advisor,"The IRS Criminal Investigation unit released new statistics on March 28 highlighting how the agency has investigated financial crimes using Bank Secrecy Act data.

Under the BSA, which was enacted in 1970, financial institutions use suspicious activity reports to notify the federal government when they encounter instances of potential money laundering or tax evasion. This data is used by federal agencies like IRS-CI to investigate money laundering and related financial crimes.

During fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, 87.3% of IRS-CI’s criminal investigations recommended for prosecution had a primary subject with a related BSA filing, and adjudicated cases resulted in a 97.3% conviction rate with defendants receiving average prison sentences of 37 months. IRS-CI also used BSA data to identify $21.1 billion in fraud tied to tax and financial crimes, seize $8.2 billion in assets tied to criminal activity, and obtain $1.4 billion in restitution for crime victims.

Guy Ficco

“Public-private partnerships thrive when everyone mutually benefits, and to enhance our partnership with the financial industry, we plan to launch CI-FIRST which will promote information-sharing, streamline processes, and demonstrate how valuable BSA data is to criminal investigations,” said IRS-CI Chief Guy Ficco.

CI-FIRST (Feedback in Response to Strategic Threats), which was introduced on Friday, is a new initiative that will establish ongoing engagement with financial institutions, IRS-CI said.

The program will ensure that financial institutions receive quantifiable results from IRS-CI on how the agency uses suspicious activity reports to investigate federal crimes. As part of this initiative, IRS-CI will also streamline subpoena requests and share pointers with financial institutions on what to include in suspicious activity reports to maximize impact.

CI-FIRST will address what’s working and what can be improved, offering continuous lines of communication between partners, IRS-CI said. The IRS unit’s headquarters will work with larger financial institutions that have a national and international presence, while its field office personnel will work with regional and community banks and credit unions.

IRS-CI special agents ran an average of 966,900 searches annually against currency transaction reports during the last three fiscal years. Nearly 1,600 cases were opened in fiscal year 2024 with at least one currency transaction report on the primary subject. The data also indicates that 67.4% of cases opened by IRS-CI had a subject with one of more currency transaction reports below $40,000, with 50% of currency transaction reports involving amounts less than $22,230.

BSA data has also proven to be effective in helping IRS-CI combat narcotics trafficking and pandemic-era tax fraud. Since fiscal year 2020, IRS-CI has used BSA data to initiate nearly 1,300 investigations with ties to fentanyl and investigate alleged Employee Retention Credit fraud totaling $5.5 billion.",2025-03-28T21:00:41,"['Guy Ficco', 'Employee Retention Credit', '’s headquarters']","['IRS-CI’s', 'BSA', 'IRS-CI', 'Bank Secrecy Act', 'IRS', 'CI-FIRST', 'The IRS Criminal Investigation']",https://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/2025/03/28/bank-secrecy-act-data-key-to-irs-ci-cracking-many-financial-crime-cases/158070/

Don’t miss this exciting GovCon conference — register before tickets are gone!

Along its half-decade journey, Consilient has formed key collaborations with Intel and K2 Integrity, as well as international entities like Harex InfoTech to establish an interconnected, global network of partners.

We wanted to know more about how Consilient is leveraging AI and ML, so we got in touch with Zarate for a further investigation into what is unique about the organization’s approach to anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, a.k.a. AML/CFT.

GovCon Wire: What problem is Consilient trying to solve?

Juan Zarate: Consilient’s mission is to be at the center of the redesign of this system so we are preventing financial crime and fraud more effectively and efficiently on a global basis. Consilient’s concept is simple, but the implications are transformational. We are the first company to apply federated AI (or federated learning) to help discover financial crime risk dynamically, collaboratively and more effectively across data sets, institutions, sectors and borders — without ever having to move, extract, or aggregate data.

This changes the paradigm for the management of illicit finance risks and fraud — moving to “insight sharing” through the sharing of models, as opposed to classic movement of data to share information; allowing data to reside and remain secure in situ, as opposed to trying to move or aggregate data into data lakes or secure enclaves; using behavioral analytics to discover unseen risk, as opposed to rules-based systems that result in 98 percent false positives in bank systems; allowing for collaboration between institutions and even between regulators and the private sector, as opposed to relying on slow, reactive ways to share information.

GCW: What results are you seeing with your customers and what’s your outlook for market expansion?

Zarate: What we are seeing with our clients is greater efficiency (massive reduction of false positives), effectiveness (discovery of unseen risk), and the ability to use Consilient’s exchange and federated learning and models to interrogate new data sets in ways impossible prior. This becomes all the more important as we have to discover more complex economic security risks in the environment — across regulatory regimes, institutions and borders — and with more and more payment disintermediation. The national economic security landscape is changing rapidly, and data will continue to be harder to move or access due to data privacy, security and sovereignty issues. Consilient’s platform, exchange and library of traveling models solves these issues by enabling dynamic risk management while preserving data privacy and security.

We are expanding Consilient’s work with financial institutions globally and are in discussions with regulators, Central Banks, and Financial Intelligence Units around the world to deploy Consilient as a tool of systemic risk discovery, regulatory oversight, and even audit. Consilient allows us to imagine an environment where different institutions, sectors and even government agencies are able to share insights dynamically to discover problematic or illicit behaviors in financial and commercial payments and transactions. This is game-changing at a time when companies and governments are looking for greater efficiencies and creative, safe ways to deploy AI.”

Fivecast revolutionizes financial crime investigations with AI-driven online insights - GlobeNewswire,"LONDON, March 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fivecast today launched its cutting-edge, AI-driven digital intelligence platform into the financial crime compliance market, enabling financial institutions to radically streamline financial crime investigations, anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), and enhanced due diligence (EDD) through online data analytics.

Fivecast empowers financial investigation teams to swiftly and efficiently assess customer risk across masses of online information. The Fivecast platform delivers relevant and actionable information from a vast range of online data sources, enabling broad digital footprint discovery combined with in-depth, AI-driven multi-media data analysis. Current sources and methods used for financial intelligence investigations are missing critical, risk-based information about customers, leading financial institutions to grossly underestimate their risk exposure.

The need for accurate, timely, and global data has never been greater. The global regulatory landscape is rapidly changing, demanding new data sources to meet evolving due diligence requirements for AML compliance. This is highlighted in guidance and consent orders from Government agencies and financial regulatory bodies across Europe, the US, and Australia. In 2024, global penalties related to financial crime imposed by U.S. regulators alone surpassed $4.3 billion.

Duane Rivett, Fivecast Co-founder and VP of Strategic Growth, said: “The vastly superior speed and accuracy of our digital intelligence platform streamlines slow, labor-intensive processes in a highly sensitive area for financial institutions. Just as national security agencies use our solutions to analyze extremist or terrorist networks online, banks are doing the same with a slightly different focus on EDD, AML, and KYC.”

Fivecast solutions empower financial investigation units to efficiently and accurately assess a customer’s risk profile to rapidly identify predicate crimes and customer risk exposure and adopt a genuine risk-based approach to compliance while minimizing compliance costs.

“Financial Crime Operations”... but not as we know it! | Future of Financial Crime - Deloitte,"The Maltese Anti-Money Laundering Act was adopted in 1994, with the Regulations coming into force in 2018. Since then, we have seen the scale and scope of regulatory expectations continue to expand and escalate, obliging regulated firms to respond through ongoing development of their compliance capabilities.

For many subject persons (SPs), the focus has been on regulatory compliance – attempting to do enough to stay out of the regulator’s gaze. However, where even this limited goal has been achieved with some measure of success, it has often been at the expense of operating efficiency.

Despite the long-held promise of technology – to enable smarter, more targeted controls and reduced operational effort – the reality is that the anti-financial crime capabilities of many organisations have not kept pace with either a rapidly evolving threat landscape or increasing regulatory expectations.

As a result, we have seen a never-ending expansion of manually intensive operational teams to process those activities intended to manage financial crime (FC) risk and ensure compliance. For some SPs, this has included building operations teams offshore in a move to manage spiralling costs. Quite simply, this cost burden is undesirable and unsustainable for many SPs.

Key challenges facing financial crime operations

Beyond simple measures of scale and cost, FC operations are typically plagued by a number of challenges to effective delivery:

Legacy technology - where SPs battle significant data deficiencies and analysts navigate multiple systems that don’t speak with each other;

Repetitive, clumsy customer interactions - where ineffective communications lead to a lack of engagement;

A struggle to attract and retain talent - where high staff turnover leads to a loss of corporate knowledge and the need for repeated training cycles; and

Lack of capacity to absorb inevitable incidents and surges – where SPs become repeatedly struggle to meet regulatory expectations and get stuck in a cycle of remediation.

But with a new generation of emerging and rapidly maturing technology capabilities, could we be on the threshold of a revolution in the way we operationally manage and execute FC compliance obligations? What will FC operations functions look like in the future? And what does this mean for people and the skills they will need?

What’s changing?

In previous blogs in the series, we have looked at some of the upstream shifts we see as critical to a future FC function – taking an intelligence-led, proactive approach to risk management, consolidating relevant internal and external data, connecting FC and monitoring capabilities, and encouraging self-service through digital-first customer journeys.

These shifts will play through into FC operations, leading to a more accurate understanding of customer risk and a reduced volume of higher quality investigations.

In parallel, Gen AI-powered solutions, better technology integration and enhanced use of data will transform the manually intensive operations processes we see today. FIs will need to explore and assess where the greatest impact may be on their operations, cognisant of the associated risks and delivery challenges, not least given the technology and data issues identified above. Objectives may include:

Minimising manual data gathering efforts from internal and external sources;

Intelligent analysis and risk identification;

Improving consistency and quality of outcomes; and

Enhancing feedback loops to monitoring and risk identification.

Collectively, such capabilities will support more efficient investigation and resolution processes, enable resources to focus on the highest and most complex risks, and create better outcomes for both customers and compliance.

What might the future look like

As FC operations become more interconnected, there will be a fundamental shift towards smaller teams with an enhanced skillset and broader capability to assess risks more holistically.

The automation of basic tasks will free up resources, removing duplication and complexity, while low value tasks which are unsuitable for automation will be outsourced. The residual teams will use a more technical skillset and expertise to make better informed risk management decisions.

With a smaller number of more highly skilled individuals, we will see different organisational structures. The factory model will become obsolete; and instead of separate isolated teams working on part of a process, analysts will operate in integrated teams, assessing different types of FC risks across the whole of the customer lifecycle.

Looking ahead, technology- and data-enabled transformation of operations and processes will be a critical priority, and a more desirable approach over offshoring all or parts of the operations function. However, given the capital investment required, we may see further growth in outsourcing FC operations rather than firms looking to develop their own next-generation FC operations capabilities. For the residual operations teams, we will see more engaging, skilled analytical work, delivering better and more sustainable risk outcomes and helping to attract and retain talent more effectively.",2025-04-02T07:00:00,"['FIs', 'Gen AI-powered', 'Regulations']",['FC'],https://www.deloitte.com/mt/en/services/consulting-financial/blogs/financial-crime-operations.html
2025 Financial Crime Report: APAC Edition - Kroll,"With geopolitical uncertainty front of mind, rapidly advancing technology development, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI), the events of the past year have only amplified the challenges of fighting financial crime in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region. Our latest research—based on a survey of executives across the region—can help leaders prepare for what’s next.

Cybersecurity and the use of AI and cryptocurrencies by criminals are seen as key areas of financial crime risk for 2025 across the five APAC countries surveyed. While there was some variation in the level of comfort in the effectiveness of organizations’ compliance programs to address these risks, most executives have concerns about the sufficiency of technology and investment.

Kroll's Financial Crime Report 2025: APAC Edition does a deep dive into trends and findings from senior executives across India, Australia, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong conducted in Q4 2024.

Key Takeaways

Consistent with global survey findings, cyberattacks, the increased use of AI by cybercriminals and increased complexity of predicate crimes are the top three reasons why respondents expect financial crimes to increase in 2025. The increasing volume, value and complexity of criminal threats combined with rapidly evolving technologies are seen as the top reasons why governments are or will be losing ground in the fight against financial crime.

While advancements in technology are increasing financial crime risks, AI in particular is seen by respondents as a key component in fighting financial crime. The majority of respondents either strongly agreed or agreed that AI developments will benefit their financial crime compliance programs.

In an environment in which financial crime risks are increasing, a very significant proportion of respondents expect enforcement action will increase or remain constant in 2025 and that cooperation between regulators and financial institutions will increase or remain constant.

Anecdotally, there is an increased focus on AML regimes across the APAC region, including a broadening of AML regulations to capture sectors such as real estate, high-value goods dealers and service providers such as lawyers and accountants.",2025-03-18T09:47:26,[],"['APAC Edition', 'APAC', 'Financial Crime Report', 'Kroll', 'AML']",https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/financial-crime-report-2025/apac
How Oracle is using AI to combat financial crime - Computer Weekly,"Oracle is bringing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to the fight against financial crime, addressing the persistent issue of false positives and high investigation costs plaguing financial institutions.

In an interview with Computer Weekly on the sidelines of Oracle CloudWorld Tour Singapore, Sonny Singh, executive vice-president and general manager of Oracle Financial Services, said traditional rule-based approaches to financial crime detection often generate a deluge of alerts, with “90% of the alerts generated typically false positives”.

“Imagine you were in a business where 90% of the work you were doing was going to result in a waste of time,” said Singh, underscoring the urgency of the problem. “Larger banks could be spending anywhere from $600m to $1bn on the resource costs of these investigations.”

Oracle is tackling the problem through AI in two ways: prioritising alerts for financial crime investigators; and automating investigative processes, such as gathering and enriching data from different sources.

“AI can help you optimise the alerts that you should truly be pursuing,” said Singh, adding that by leveraging AI models and generative AI capabilities, alerts with higher probabilities of indicating criminal activity can be prioritised, allowing investigators to focus their efforts effectively.

On automating investigative processes, Oracle recently introduced agentic AI capabilities in its Investigation Hub service designed to surface key insights, collect evidence and generate alert narratives, providing a view of the entities and transactions under investigation.

To achieve this, Oracle uses graph technology to track layered transactions, a common tactic used by money launderers to obscure the origin and movement of funds. By visualising the flow of funds, investigators can more easily identify suspicious patterns and networks.

Singh said this allows investigators to analyse “higher quality alerts that have a higher propensity to reflect financial crime” while equipped with “much better tools to investigate and identify if this is something that needs to be reported to law enforcement”.

“And when you report to law enforcement, you must fill out reports and generative AI can help you look at all the data, identify elements that should go into that report, and automatically generate those reports that still have human oversight as a final check,” he added.

Addressing concerns about governance and the potential risks of AI agents, Singh said Oracle provides model management capabilities that allow financial institutions to demonstrate transparency and fulfil their regulatory responsibilities by showing how their models are explainable and governed.

Oracle also employs “compliance agents” – AI-powered bad actors – to test the thresholds of a bank’s financial controls and identify vulnerabilities. “They are almost like ethical hackers of your financial controls,” said Singh.

While acknowledging that AI agent technology is still in its early stages, Singh said Oracle is building observability and monitoring capabilities into its AI offerings, ensuring responsible and effective deployment.

“That type of instrumentation has to be built-in, and we are incorporating that where applicable,” Singh said. “We are also learning the process of how this is done. Oracle provides the technological tooling to be able to create observability inside of these applications and we are constantly evolving that capability.”

Singh noted that larger financial institution customers with very stringent data privacy and sovereignty requirements tend to deploy Oracle’s AI capabilities in a private cloud.

“This type of data has reputational elements, and they are very nervous about information about their banks being used as conduits for money laundering, so there’s a lot of focus on keeping this environment very controlled. Many of them will automatically default to doing this inside their datacentres.

“Not all workloads are moving to the cloud, even now,” Singh added, noting that over time, however, large financial institutions will likely progress towards public cloud deployments for their AI workloads.

Besides Oracle, SymphonyAI, a software company that builds AI capabilities for specific industries and use cases, has also been active in the fight against financial crime, having built a technology platform used by major financial institutions to investigate and manage money laundering cases.

Mike Foster, the former CEO of SymphonyAI’s anti-money laundering technology specialist Sensa-NetReveal, told Computer Weekly that the company’s advantage lies not only in its platform, which has a heritage of over 20 years, but also industry expertise and predictive AI models that had been developed within the SymphonyAI business.",2025-03-17T07:00:00,"['Mike Foster', 'Oracle', 'Singh', 'Sonny Singh']","['Sensa-NetReveal', 'Oracle Financial Services', 'Investigation Hub', 'Oracle', 'Computer Weekly', 'Oracle’s AI', 'AI', 'Oracle CloudWorld Tour Singapore']",https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366621012/How-Oracle-is-using-AI-to-combat-financial-crime

Credas CEO recommends robust ID verification to fight financial fraud in property market - Biometric Update,"The property market in the UK, like elsewhere, is not spared from financial fraud. But in order to reverse the tides, estate and letting agents must ensure they put in place effective digital ID verification and due diligence systems.

This is according to Tim Barnett, Chief Executive Officer of Credas Technologies, a Cardiff-based digital ID verification and compliance software provider.

His remarks, shared in a news release, come in the wake of findings of the Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) Annual Report 2023-24 by the UK Financial Intelligence Unit (UKFIU) which indicate that the property market in the UK remains a major target for financial fraudsters. Going by the report, 1,044 SARs were submitted by estate and letting agents in 2023-24, a 9.9 percent increase from the year prior, although this is said to represent only an insignificant number of total SARs.

According to Barnett, estate agents who want to effectively tackle financial fraud challenges in the ever-evolving property market, must make sure they adopt the right anti-money laundering (AML) measures.

“The latest SARs report shows progress, but estate agents must do more. Criminals continue to exploit the property sector, and while reporting has increased, the numbers remain worryingly low. With £240 million in criminal assets denied last year, the financial crime risks in real estate are clear,” Barnett said.

He therefore advises that “estate agents must take their compliance obligations seriously, ensuring they have robust identity verification and due diligence processes in place,” given that “the property sector remains a key battleground in the fight against financial crime.”

Last year, Barnett also share insights on how the UK can strengthen its AML regulations. Early this year, the UK also announced a timeline for the implementation of new measures to better tackle money laundering and corporate fraud.

Meanwhile, in a recent blog post, Credas also made the case for agents to have robust AML check mechanisms in place for the property industry in the UK which has evolved to become one of the most financial crime-prone sectors. For example, a Transparency International UK analysis reveals that about £5.9 billion worth of suspicious money was used to purchase property in the UK through Overseas Territory companies.

Credas argues that because of the high risk of fraud in the sector, estate agents have the obligation to adopt AML and customer due diligence and compliance processes in line with the UK’s Money Laundering Regulation 2017. Such AML checks, he points out, should include proof of identity for the client, source of funds, and proof of ownership for the person selling the property.

Going further, the firm highlights the necessity for estate agents to conduct AML checks for several critical reasons, namely to ensure regulatory compliance, enable agents identify and prevent illegal activities such as money laundering, fraud or terrorism financing, protect their business, and to help prevent organized crime, among other reasons.

The company indicates that among its services, it enables real estate and letting agents seamlessly carry out the required anti-money laundering checks – from ID verification to sanctions screening – when selling a house.

Credas believes respecting AML rules is crucial for the property market. There have been reports of some agents being sanctioned for non-respect of AML rules. In one instance, at least 144 agents were sanctioned for offences committed between October and December 2023, with imposed fines of between £1,250 and £52,000.

Recently, the Council of Europe announced that in collaboration with the Financial Monitoring Center, the Ministry of Justice, the Chamber of Advocates and the State Revenues Committee of Armenia, it held a capacity building event to encourage compliance with AML procedures. The event brought together legal professionals, real estate brokers and gambling service providers in that country.

In order to better check the flow of funds into the global real estate market, Transparency International says it collaborated with the Anti-Corruption Data Collective (ACDC) to develop the Opacity in Real Estate Ownership (OREO) Index, an Index that evaluates the ideal framework to protect real estate markets from suspicious funds.

behavioural analytics Share

Financial crime in Europe has reached alarming levels, with an estimated $750 billion in illicit funds flowing through the continent’s financial system in 2023, according to Nasdaq Verafin’s Financial Crime Insights: Europe report. This staggering figure represents 2.3% of the total European GDP and highlights the scale of fraud, money laundering, and other illicit financial activities threatening global economies.

Digital payment fraud is a significant contributor to this crisis, accounting for $103.6 billion in financial losses across Europe. In the U.S., fraud cases surged 22% year-over-year, underscoring the growing sophistication of cybercriminals who exploit real-time payments and emerging digital financial platforms. From identity theft and account takeovers to synthetic identity fraud, attackers are using advanced tactics to evade detection.

Cross-Border Transactions: A Key Risk

The report reveals that of all illicit funds laundered in Europe, $194.9 billion was moved across borders, demonstrating the vulnerabilities in international financial flows. With the expansion of digital payments and cross-border transactions, regulators and financial institutions face increased challenges in monitoring and preventing fraudulent activity. Criminal networks exploit peer-to-peer payments, cryptocurrency platforms, and real-time banking services, making illicit funds harder to trace and recover.

AI and Machine Learning in Fraud Detection

To combat rising fraud, banks and payment providers are leveraging AI and machine learning to enhance real-time fraud detection. Behavioral analytics and biometric authentication, such as fingerprint and facial recognition, are being integrated into payment systems to prevent unauthorised transactions. Additionally, regulatory bodies are tightening compliance measures, with PSD2 regulations in Europe and similar frameworks in the U.S. reinforcing the need for stricter anti-fraud protocols.

“Banks, borders, or regulations do not bind criminals,” said Stephanie Champion, EVP and Head of Nasdaq Verafin. “By aligning on shared goals, financial institutions can strengthen economies and safeguard the global financial system from harm.”

Governments, banks, and regulators are increasingly collaborating through data-sharing alliances and fraud intelligence networks to counter financial crime. Law enforcement agencies are cracking down on cybercrime syndicates, dismantling fraud rings, and arresting key operatives. However, as digital payments evolve, fraudsters are becoming more adaptive, requiring continuous advancements in security infrastructure.

With illicit financial activity accelerating, financial institutions must prioritise data-driven strategies, AI-driven fraud prevention, and global cooperation. Nasdaq Verafin’s report emphasises the importance of stakeholder alignment and advanced technology innovation to curb financial crime.

The challenge ahead is balancing convenience and security in digital payments while staying ahead of cybercriminals. The financial industry must act decisively to reinforce trust in digital transactions and ensure a safer, more secure financial ecosystem worldwide.",2025-04-03T11:58:11,"['750bn', 'Gloria Methri', 'Nasdaq Verafin’s', 'Machine Learning', 'Stephanie Champion']","['EVP', 'AI', 'Digital', 'Nasdaq Verafin’s Financial Crime Insights: Europe']",https://ibsintelligence.com/ibsi-news/financial-crime-in-europe-surges-where-did-750bn-in-dirty-money-go/

Jinisha Bhatt: The Human Cost of Financial Crime - ACAMS Today,"ACAMS Today sat down with Jinisha Bhatt for International Women’s Day 2025. She is an anti-financial crime (AFC) investigator specializing in multi-jurisdictional cryptocurrency fraud, money laundering and human trafficking (HT) investigations. She is passionate about addressing the human cost of financial crime, believing that “most crimes against humanity, society and the environment have a pecuniary motive. Fighting these crimes through a financial lens is how I get to make a small dent in the universe.”

As a compliance consultant for digital asset and fintech organizations in the U.S. and Canada, Bhatt conducts large-scale cryptocurrency fraud investigations, including pig butchering schemes. In addition, she provides expert witness testimony. Previously, she contributed to Kraken Exchange’s compliance function, conducting financial crime investigations to meet regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions.

Bhatt also founded the Canada Anti-Human Trafficking Consortium (CAHTC)1 and collaborates with law enforcement (LE) and private-sector entities to enhance HT victim identification and prosecution rates. By leveraging publicly available data, CAHTC delivers actionable intelligence to LE.

In addition to investigations, Bhatt is a frequent moderator, panelist and speaker, educating audiences on cryptocurrency compliance, anti-money laundering regulations and financial crime.

Committed to integrity, Bhatt ensures her personal actions align with her professional principles. She actively avoids goods and services linked to modern slavery, wildlife trafficking or environmental harm and supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Target 8.7: eradicating forced labor and modern slavery.

ACAMS Today (AT): What inspired you to focus your career on combating financial crimes, particularly at the intersection of money laundering, cryptocurrency fraud and HT?

Jinisha Bhatt (JB): Early on in my career, I worked at financial institutions (FIs) that were exposed to criminal elements. Even though these Fis where centered in financial crime detection, they did not actually lead to significant positive change in this collective fight.

As a result, a paradigm shift led me to see the untapped potential of data-gathering and intel-sharing. My primary motivation to transition into crypto investigations was traceability and speed of transactions. Before I made the transition, I invested in a blockchain forensics designation and found myself beguiled by the infrastructure and the shared ethos of the crypto compliance community at large. While many financial crime typologies are similar in traditional and decentralized finance, as an investigator, I had more transactional data at my disposal in the crypto space by virtue of distributed ledgers and block explorers. I also found myself conducting faster and proactive investigations while collaborating with compliant crypto platforms.

AT: This year’s International Women’s Day theme is “#AccelerateAction.” How does this resonate with your work in financial crime prevention, and what actions do you believe are most urgent?

JB: First, let us please acknowledge that raising awareness alone is not mobilizing change and eliciting true cooperation. Grappling with this idea provided the impetus for my work and nonprofit endeavors. I believe we must leverage data to illuminate the magnitude and nature of the epidemic that is financial crime.

We must appreciate what data can teach us about systemic failures in the financial sector. The AFC industry must confront the fact that we have not been able to markedly curb the amount of proceeds being laundered even though we are producing a record number of suspicious activity reports each year and building sophisticated tools to detect suspicious activity. As per the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, less than 1% of proceeds of crime are seized,2 while criminals are rarely prosecuted, and victims are rarely compensated.

This is a clarion call for a fundamental shift in our approach. We need to urgently focus on collaboration, timely data-sharing and collectively fixate on prosecuting criminals who go scot-free.

First, we must humanize victims of financial crime. Financial crimes often disproportionately impact women and marginalized groups, exacerbating existing inequalities. Urgent action is needed to develop and implement persona-specific detection methodologies that address the unique risk factors and realities intersectional groups face in their daily lives.

Then, we should focus on asset recovery and victim restitution. While we have been focused on detecting and preventing crime, we need to invest in empowering victims and creating meaningful financial inclusion. It is believed that an average survivor of human trafficking is revictimized between five to 13 times before they are emancipated. The national recidivism rate for women with prostitution-related offenses in the U.S. is about 80%.3 As a result, victims of sex trafficking and financial coercion are financially excluded by institutions, making them vulnerable to financial crimes such as forced criminality and fraud.

Finally, we need to strengthen legal frameworks. Accelerating the implementation and enforcement of laws that protect vulnerable groups from financial exploitation and ensure equal protection under the law is required.

AT: Can you share a specific success story from your work with CAHTC that reflects the importance of accelerating action in combating HT?

JB: During Super Bowl LVII in 2023, a group of volunteers (who would later join CAHTC) and I led the open-source intelligence (OSINT) investigations team to support a nonprofit victim extraction mission. We scraped thousands of escort ads to analyze the most egregious ones and potentially identify victims who may want to be extracted.

Our partner’s outreach team left voicemails and text messages to one of the phone numbers we had scraped. After leaving voicemails and text messages to a phone number in our dataset, our partners received a call back from a single mother. She had researched our nonprofit partner’s background and had decided to ask for help.

The woman was an interesectionally vulnerable victim of a brutally abusive guerilla pimp4 who had been forcing her to inject hard drugs. Her activities were constantly monitored by a heavily organized drug, weapons and sex trafficking network. Her trafficker regularly threatened to use force against her children if she did not comply with his demands to make a few thousand dollars every day. Her phone was also being monitored.

After a particularly violent beating, she had decided to take a screenshot of a text message she received from our partner and shared it with a friend via Snapchat. This allowed her the opportunity to delete any messages exchanged between us. Once safe, she retrieved our partner’s toll-free number from her friend and called to request an immediate pickup. She asked our partners to bring baby clothes, food and diapers on their way. Within hours, our partners were able to pick her up along with her two children and bring them to a safe house.

When I think about this family, I cannot help but ruminate over the opportunities we have to identify and protect victims by galvanizing society into accelerated action.

AT: How do financial crimes like HT disproportionately impact women and girls, and what can AFC professionals do to address this disparity?

JB: Women and girls account for 71% of all trafficked victims detected globally, with young girls representing almost three-quarters of identified child trafficking victims5. Females represent 96% of victims trafficked for sexual exploitation, which is the most predominant form of global trafficking currently detected, accounting for 54% of all forms of trafficking.4

Women and girls are also more vulnerable to exploitation during conflicts, post-conflict settings, and humanitarian crises due to the absence of the rule of law.

To address this disparity, AFC professionals can take several actions:

Enhance intersectional-specific detection methodologies: Develop and implement programs that address the unique risk factors and realities of intersectionality-vulnerable groups in their daily lives, including experiences of victimization and practical difficulties.

Appreciate the nuances of forced criminality: Women and particularly victims of HT are often forced to commit financial crime while compromising their own credit history. FIs could engage with survivors to ensure victims are not unintentionally excluded from the financial system.

Cross-train: AFC professionals could enhance their understanding of gender-specific financial crime by adopting a holistic mindset and investigating epistemologies not commonly used in a conventional AFC career. For instance, many volunteers at CAHTC.org constantly learn about new HT and fraud typologies by engaging in OSINT investigations.

Adopt a cross-sectoral framework: While we systemically struggle to enhance interagency cooperation and regulatory alignment, as individuals we could build pathways to engage with as many stakeholders as we can to actively fight against financial crime.

AT: What message would you like to share with women in the AFC community on International Women’s Day, and how can they contribute to accelerating action in their respective roles?

JB: There are several ways women in the AFC space can make a difference.

They can create opportunities for survivors. Women in the AFC community are best equipped to close the divide between virtue signaling and meaningful action by demanding and leading change. When they find themselves in leadership positions, they could use their privilege to architect programs to create more opportunities for survivors and advocate for products that enhance financial inclusion across the board.

This can spark a bottom-up movement. If they happen to be in the second line of defense, they must not wait for the tone from the top to change. Change can be created through a bottom-up approach if a group of committed human beings align their actions with the corporate values they espouse and demand clear action from the top.

They can evaluate corporate values. When choosing a job, women could look more closely at their prospective employers’ environmental social governance commitments and evaluate claims of tangible impact. I want to highlight the difference between virtue signaling and tangible change. Many FIs appear to be optical allies of survivors without making a marginal investment in the growth and inclusion of survivors in the financial system.

They can acknowledge their role. We should acknowledge that we too are complicit in perpetuating modern slavery when we opt to patronize exploitative businesses and practices. The majority of the goods we consume are slave-tainted.6 It is up to us to learn the origin of the products we consume, take a clear stance against labor and sexual exploitation, and vote with our dollars. This generation of financial crime fighters has the burden and the opportunity to end the cycle of exploitation.

They can take a stance against willful blindness. Any exposure to HT entities should be immediately demarketed. Recent history has illustrated that well-known human traffickers have enjoyed many privileges at storied institutions with entrenched impunity. Women must unite and resist willful ignorance at any cost.

AT: In addition to CAHTC, is there another nonprofit you support to benefit your community?

JB: I support several survivor leaders on their journey to economic and social mobilization. I support Amnesty International’s efforts to defend human rights across the world.

I contribute to a Canadian youth-led organization called One Child7 that empowers youth to take action against sexual exploitation.

I also contribute to a Wyoming-based nonprofit called Uprising8 in their efforts to curate actionable educational events for the greater anti-trafficking community.

Dissecting the environmental financial crime nexus: A spotlight on the illegal wildlife trade - wwf.org.uk,"Dissecting the environmental financial crime nexus: A spotlight on the illegal wildlife trade

This report contributes to the Environmental Crimes Financial Toolkit being developed by WWF and Themis, as part of the Climate Solutions Partnership, a collaboration between HSBC, the World Resources Institute, and WWF.

The Environmental Crimes Financial Toolkit (ECFT) is an online platform that assists financial institutions in monitoring risks related to deforestation and land conversion – and, more broadly, environmental crimes – that could be linked to financial operations. By highlighting red flags and risks associated with various types of environmental and financial crimes, the Toolkit helps financial institutions (FIs) strengthen their screening processes when reviewing existing clients, onboarding new ones, and assessing sectoral risks.

This report focuses on the intersectionality between Illegal Wildlife Trade (IWT) and financial crimes, which undermines global sustainability and conservation efforts. It dissects the complexity of the IWT and financial crime nexus by analysing evidence, perceptions, and risks for Financial Institutions (FI). Led by WWF and Themis, this work benefits from a series of real-world case studies from guest contributors, with global experts and organisations working at the frontline sharing unique insights and potential solutions.

Isle of Man: Boost for fight against financial crime from overseas - BBC,"Boost for island's fight against financial crime

12 March 2025 Share Save Ashlea Tracey BBC News, Isle of Man Share Save

BBC New gaming licence applications on the island will be subject to ""heightened scrutiny""

The Manx government is set to bolster its defences against ""evolving"" threats to the island's financial and online gambling industries by international criminals. A spokeswoman said online gaming and gambling platforms were at the centre of an ""increasingly complex and sophisticated criminal landscape in east and south-east Asia"". Some of the Gambling Supervision Commission's (GSC) processes are set to be strengthened and new gaming licence applications will be subject to more scrutiny. Deputy Chief Minister Jane Poole-Wilson said the government would ""not hesitate to act to disrupt and prosecute"" anyone using the island for criminal activity.

She said ""illicit actions by transnational organised criminals to exploit the island's business environment and immigration security"" were taken ""extremely seriously"" by the government and Manx authorities. In a statement, a spokeswoman said the risks presented by overseas criminal networks were now affecting jurisdictions worldwide and ""increasing vigilance"" was needed when conducting business linked to the region. As an international financial centre with links to the UK, the Isle of Man is ""attractive for exploitation"" by organised crime groups, she said.

Women in Anti-Financial Crime—A Global Phenomenon - ACAMS Today,"There are many courageous women throughout the world striving to ensure justice, equality and the protection of human rights as they fight against financial crime. The following is a snapshot demonstrating exceptional courage and dedication by professional women—not only in their respective countries but beyond. Their activities show the importance of the continuous fight against crime.

Daria Kaleniuk

Daria Kaleniuk is a Ukrainian civil society activist who has played a key role in advocating for anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine, including the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the implementation of electronic asset declarations for public officials. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, she has shifted her focus from anti-corruption to the importance for democracies to fend off autocratic assaults and attacks from oligarchs and companies who profit from funneling funds into the war.1

Khadija Ismayilova

Khadija Ismayilova is an Azerbaijani investigative journalist known for her courageous reporting on corruption within Azerbaijan’s ruling elite. Working with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, she has exposed significant financial crimes, including embezzlement and money laundering within the regime of President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan. Ismayilova also worked with Swedish Television to uncover the close ties between the ruling elite and the Swedish telecom company TeliaSonera. Ismayilova was detained in Baku in 2014 for 18 months on what are widely believed to be politically motivated charges. Her arrest has been condemned by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other international organizations.2

Anne Brorhilker

Anne Brorhilker, a German prosecutor is renowned for her extensive investigations into the CumEx tax fraud scandal. Often described as the largest tax heist in German history, the scandal centered on multiple illegal refund claims of withholding taxes on dividend payments, costing European governments (especially Germany) billions of euros in lost tax revenue. Between 2013 and 2023, she led numerous raids and legal actions against individuals and institutions involved in these complex tax evasion schemes. In April 2024, she resigned from her position due to concerns over insufficient resources in the judiciary to effectively combat financial crime. Since then, she has been working for the consumer financial lobby group Finanzwende as managing director.3

Éliane Houlette

Éliane Houlette was a French magistrate before retiring in 2019 after having spent most of her career in the public prosecutor’s office. As the first chief of the Parquet National Financier (PNF), she oversaw major investigations and helped establish the PNF as a central force in holding individuals and institutions accountable for economic and financial misconduct. Her legacy influences the continued work of the PNF and other French legal bodies dedicated to enforcing financial integrity. Between 2014 and 2019, she was the financial public prosecutor in charge of investigating the scandal implicating the former French prime minister, François Fillon, and his wife. Fillon was found guilty of embezzlement of public funds and sentenced to five years in prison, three of which were suspended.4

Ilda Boccassini

Ilda Boccassini, an Italian magistrate renowned for her relentless pursuit of organized crime, worked closely with famed anti-Mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. She played a pivotal role in prosecuting high-profile cases, including those against former prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, for corruption and his association with the Mafia.

Her first major case was the Duomo Connection investigation, in which she and Falcone prosecuted Mafia connections in northern Italy.5 She was appointed deputy public prosecutor of the Court of Milan in 2009 where she was involved in the proceedings during the 2011–2013 trial against then-incumbent Prime Minister Berlusconi.6 Boccassini retired in 2019. In 2021, Boccassini published a book about her career, La Stanza Numero 30 (Room Number 30).7

Flor de Maria Vega Zapata

Flor de Maria Vega Zapata is Peru’s national coordinator for environmental prosecutors, leading a team that investigates and prosecutes transnational criminal organizations that are active in illegal mining and illegal logging. Illegal gold mining in Peru has led to the growth of a clan-based criminal ecosystem that undermines the rule of law through corruption, facilitates human trafficking (HT) and destroys natural resources. It is also a main cause of biodiversity loss in the Peruvian Amazon, creating health issues amongst the locals. Zapata succeeded in filing 500 cases against illegal miners in 2016 alone, leading to the first convictions of illegal mining in 2019. Her team investigated and seized $1.6 million dollars in illegal timber, the largest illegal logging shipment in Peru’s history. Her work on the illegal logging case proved to be a watershed moment in Peru’s fight against this crime. She was recognized with the International Women of Courage Award in 2019.8

Alika Kinan

Alika Kinan is a survivor of HT who works on the investigation of the crimes of HT and exploitation. The aim of her work is to improve the processes of the analysis, formulation, development and application of legislation and public policies.9 Among her main achievements is winning the first trial in Argentina where the victim, after being rescued from 16 years of sexual slavery, became a plaintiff to litigate against her traffickers. The U.S. Department of State honored her with the Hero Acting to End Modern Slavery Award in 2017 for her anti-trafficking activism.10

Sunitha Krishnan

Sunitha Krishnan is an Indian social activist and co-founder of Prajwala, a nongovernmental organization that rescues, rehabilitates and reintegrates sex-trafficked victims into society. She is an advisor to several state governments to develop holistic victim services and also plays an important role in the Inter-Ministerial Committee at the national level by drafting comprehensive legislation on HT. She was honored with the fourth-highest civilian honor, the Padmashree, in 2016.11

Conclusion

This article underscores a powerful common thread that connects the work of these diverse women from around the globe, who have taken great risks to protect the rule of law, promote transparency and safeguard human rights. Whether it is taking on corrupt regimes, pursuing high-profile financial criminals, defending environmental resources or advocating for survivors of HT, each of these professionals has demonstrated perseverance and courage in their drive for a better world.

Financial crime expert urges Brits to stay alert – HMRC scams surge as new tax year begins - London Daily News,"With the new tax year kicking off on Sunday 6th April, fraudsters are ramping up their efforts to catch people off guard, targeting unsuspecting Brits expecting tax rebates or filing self-assessment returns.

According to findings from Ocean Finance, one in three people (38%) have either been scammed or know someone who has. Meanwhile, one in five Brits (20%) worry about fraudsters posing as trusted organisations like banks, energy firms, or government departments. The risk is growing – 20% of Brits admit they’d click on a suspicious link, making them easy targets for phishing scams.

In the past year alone, 337,352 reports of cybercrime and fraud were made in the UK, with £2bn lost to scammers.

Siobhan Blagbrough, Financial Crime Manager at Ocean Finance, warns:

“Scammers know people are expecting tax-related messages at this time of year, making it easier for them to strike. Self-employed workers and people expecting tax rebates are prime targets. Let’s be clear – HMRC will never call, text, or email you out of the blue demanding payment. If you get a call threatening arrest for tax evasion, it’s a scam. If you weren’t expecting a message from HMRC, don’t click, don’t reply, and don’t share personal details. “Fraudsters use aggressive scare tactics, spoofed text messages, and fake websites to pressure people into handing over sensitive information. If a website looks familiar but something feels off, report it using the HMRC phishing scam form. We’re all busy but taking a few seconds to stop and think before you act could save you thousands.”

On what to do if you’ve been scammed, Siobhan Blagbrough adds:

Contact Your Bank or Card Provider: “Report the fraud immediately. Your bank can block further transactions, investigate, and potentially refund your money. The quicker you act, the better.”

Request a Chargeback: “If you paid via debit card, chargeback could help recover your money. This process allows you to dispute an unauthorised transaction and request a refund.”

Report the Scam: “Contact Action Fraud to help authorities track down criminals and prevents future scams.”

Update Your Passwords: “If scammers got hold of your login details, change your passwords immediately. Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication. Over half of Brits (53%) use the same password across multiple accounts*, leaving them wide open to hackers.”

"Financial Crime Compliance – Rising Costs, Other Trends - Wealth Briefing","ComplyAdvantage, the global fintech customer onboarding, transaction monitoring and sanctions screening firm, has published its fifth ‘state of the world’ report on financial firms’ struggles against financial crime.

The report, entitled The State of Financial Crime 2025, is based on a survey of 600 C-suite and senior compliance decision-makers at sizeable financial and fintech firms in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Holland, Hong Kong, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. Most financiers were in banking – especially private banking – and payments.

Fifty-one per cent of firms surveyed saw compliance costs rise by over 10 per cent in 2022 and 2023 – a trend that seems to be continuing. Organised crime, meanwhile, is playing an increasingly dominant role in global criminality, aided by the continuous easing of trade and travel all over the world, by the rise of the Internet and by communications technology such as smartphones.

The parts of the report that concern us here are those that affect compliance with anti-fraud and anti-money-laundering (AML) laws and rules at private banks and other wealth management firms. The report’s authors, Andrew Davies and Iain Armstrong of ComplyAdvantage, answered questions in a recent webinar that WealthBriefing attended. Among their top concerns was a desire to make the onboarding process as free of inconvenience as possible with the aim of avoiding ‘customer abandonment’ – the bane of compliance in the wealth management sector.

A bull in a china shop

The report notes that, in recent years, western governments such as the US under President Biden have taken an increasing interest in official corruption in authoritarian or hybrid regimes, especially the misappropriation of public or assets by elite figures within or attached to regimes, often described as ‘kleptocracy.’ The report was published too early to take account of the incoming President Trump’s decision not to use governmental agencies to enforce the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977, the world’s pioneering piece of anti-corruption legislation.

Armstrong, the consultancy’s regulatory affairs practice lead, told attendees: “Some countries in Europe have only recently brought such laws in. We should expect other radical moves and they will not be uncommon in the years ahead. Nevertheless, when I look across my [compliance] network, the initial reaction to Trump’s FCPA move is: ‘well this has happened, but I'm not going to change my policies.’ When somebody dilutes some regulation it doesn't necessarily mean that you have to change anything in your programmes.”

Delegates at the online conference noted also that Elon Musk had been deregulating and streamlining with extreme prejudice ever since the beginning of the Trump presidency. One remarked: “He could do worse than to harmonise federal and state cyber-regulations, streamline things and cut out the duplication.” This may well happen.

The need to identify the ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs) of bodies corporate is another major job for MLROs at private banks, dealing as they do with UHNW shareholders on a daily basis. In 2024 the US Government enacted updates to the Corporate Transparency Act and the Bank Secrecy Act, particularly regarding beneficial ownership. The report looks forward to greater beneficial ownership transparency in 2025 throughout the world, with an international drive underway to improve the accuracy of UBO information contained in corporate registries. This, however, is now out of date in respect of one country. On 2 March Trump suspended all enforcement of the Corporate Transparency Act against US citizens and domestic reporting companies.

Meanwhile, on 31 January, Trump signed an executive order to ensure that whenever an agency promulgates a new rule, regulation or guidance, it must earmark at least 10 existing rules, regulations, or guidance documents to be repealed. This is a turbo-charged version of the ‘2-for-1’ order of his first presidential term.

Michael Knight-Robson, a director at the accountancy firm of BDO, went as far as describing President Trump as “a bull in a china shop” and warning that “some jurisdictions like the USA might pull away from some of the Financial Action Task Force’s 40 recommendations.” These are the global anti-money-laundering (AML) standards which have been in place, in some form or another, since 1989.

Factors that hamper compliance

ComplyAdvantage asked the respondents a simple question which elicited many answers from each person: What are the main limitations to your organisation's current approach to financial crime detection? The results were as follows.

Siloed datasets....................................………..45%

Lack of real-time visibility into risks..................45%

Data quality.......................................……….…44%

Sanctions/watchlist screening..........................43%

Ongoing monitoring.................................……..41%

Lack of rule flexibility...........................……......41%

Unclear regulatory expectations.......................35%

Lack of effective case management...................5%

There are no current limitations....................…..1%

It comes as no surprise that 99 per cent of the survey’s participants acknowledged the existence of barriers to successful crime detection. As many were from multinationals, including private banks, it was also inevitable that data silos – collections of data held by one group that are not easily accessible by others in the same organisation – were a major frustration for compliance officers and money-laundering reporting officers (MLROs). Forty-five per cent of respondents said that they were sometimes unable to draw links between pieces of related data. ComplyAdvantage put this down to an inability to collect data of high quality and make inferences from it quickly. One ComplyAdvantage AML expert said that this was a problem at many of the large banks with which he conversed.

Artificial intelligence

For the second year in a row, the survey showed that the participants were fairly comfortable with their use of AI, which one delegate defined as “the use of technology to quantify large datasets.”

Intriguingly – especially in light of respondents’ stated understanding of AI regulations and the importance of transparency – 46 per cent that said they were very comfortable and 45 per cent said that they were somewhat comfortable with “compromising explainability in return for increased automation and efficiency.”

This is not what regulators want to hear. ‘Transparency and explainability’ occur when the developers (software vendors) and deployers (private banks, asset managers, networks etc) of AI understand the ways in which their systems work and are able to explain them – clearly, easily and credibly – to regulators, customers and anyone else who might be affected by those systems’ decisions – especially adverse ones.

In March 2023, HM Government published its AI Regulation White Paper which set out five principles for regulators to interpret and apply within their remit. One of these was ""appropriate transparency and explainability."" Moreover, the paper said that this rule underpinned all the others. The report therefore implies that any financial firm that is not able to explain the workings of its AI programs to regulators is playing with fire.

AI vendors are often not very good at explaining their own products to compliance officers. A successful sale depends to a great extent on the purchasing bank (or other wealth management firm) asking the vendor a blizzard of questions about the applicability of the software to its particular data sets and corporate habits. In too many instances, this does not happen. Also, not every AI vendor lets the bank’s compliance department test its software before the purchase.

With KYC, firms now have AI-powered entity resolution, a process that identifies and matches records across multiple data sources to create a golden record of key business entities, to help them verify people's identities. Knight-Robson explained: “It’s not just your typical driver's licence, passport, scanned copy, or using Experian or Equifax...it’s the use of multiple sources to help with that identification.”

AI is also used in trade financial AML because it can analyse documents faster than humans. Various delegates at financial firms commented that they were thinking of using it to “empower our analysts” as well. Every SAR has a space in which the MLRO can write a narrative that explains why the activity is suspicious and firms are now using AI to write these as well. Davies thought that the cost of using such techniques was going down.

Can AI ever be trusted to take AML decisions on its own? Armstrong thought that it might be possible.

“You need to think about where you have high-volume, low-risk scenarios that lend themselves to that rapid yes-no decision making. Clearly there are more complex scenarios where AI should only really be supporting human decision-making. We see that a lot with name screening for adverse media and political exposure, where context is everything. We've noticed that you can get an increase in speed or the time taken to work an alert if you have the right level of context for an AI-generated alert.”

Davies added that the use of AI was not mandated in any jurisdictions of which he was aware.

Delegates were reminded that their criminal adversaries were using AI as well. They, of course, are not limited by considerations of data privacy, anti-corruption legislation or agencies such as the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which President Trump is trying to close down.

Countries on the FATF grey list

At the end of last month the FATF updated its so-called grey list of ""jurisdictions under increased monitoring"" by adding Kenya and Namibia and removing Barbados, Gibraltar, Uganda and the United Arab Emirates.

The survey asked each company to pick the country on the list that concerned it the most. The results, listed from the country that inspired the most worry to the one that inspired the least, are as follows: The Philippines; South Africa; Kenya; Nigeria; The Democratic Republic of Congo; Burkina Faso; Syria; Cameroun; Vietnam; Mozambique; Monaco; Bulgaria; South Sudan; Venezuela; Croatia; Haiti; Namibia; Senegal; Mali; Tanzania; and Yemen.

Here and there

The conference noted that the European Commission (the nearest thing that the European Union has to an executive branch) has, according to POLITICO, decided to withdraw its proposal for a Financial Data Access (FIDA) regulation as a result of opposition from the financial services sector and the French government. This was hailed as a missed opportunity for some useful 'open finance' rules that would have facilitated the sharing of financial data between banks and HNWs' third-party service providers through Application Programming Interfaces. One delegate said that, if true, it would be ""a blow against modernisation in the EU.""

The conference heard that in Australia on 31 March, changes to the 'tipping off' offence will come into effect. This offence is committed when a bank discloses information to a customer that is likely to prejudice an investigation.

In May, dealers in high-value goods and services will begin to report sanctions breaches to HM Revenue and Customs in the UK. The UK is a major international hub for the trade of high value goods, including art, antiques, luxury cars, precious metals and gemstones, and for investment in wines and whiskies to name a few. In 2023 it accounted for 17 per cent of the world market in art sales, according to HMRC.

On 1 September, a new fraud prevention offence will take effect in the UK. A private bank or other wealth-management firm may be held criminally liable whenever its employee, agent, subsidiary or other “associated person” commits a fraud with the intention of benefiting the organisation.

Examples may include dishonest sales practices, hiding important information from clients or investors or dishonest practices in financial markets. In the event of prosecution, the bank will have to prove that it had reasonable fraud prevention measures in place at the time.",2025-03-07T08:00:00,"['Trump', 'Michael Knight-Robson', 'Andrew Davies', 'Elon Musk', 'Biden', 'Equifax', 'Armstrong']","['Trump', 'HM Revenue', 'the European Union', 'ComplyAdvantage', 'HM Government', 'AML', 'AI', 'POLITICO', 'MLRO', 'Trump’s', 'ComplyAdvantage AML', 'Mozambique', 'The State of Financial Crime', 'Financial Data Access', 'the Financial Action Task Force’s', 'Barbados, Gibraltar', 'Application Programming Interfaces', 'UBO', 'EU', 'WealthBriefing', 'the European Commission', 'the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau', 'Customs', 'Knight-Robson', 'grey list', 'BDO', 'the US Government', 'FATF', 'AI Regulation White Paper', 'UHNW', 'KYC']",https://www.wealthbriefing.com/html/article.php/financial-crime-compliance--rising-costs%2C-other-trends

IRS crime fighting arm announces modernization program as financial crimes use more tech - The Independent,"For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

As the nature of financial crime changes, with technology and AI increasingly used to perpetrate illegal acts, the IRS' crime fighting arm —IRS Criminal Investigation— is announcing a new program intended to improve how it interacts with financial institutions.

Called Feedback in Response to Strategic Threat —or CI-FIRST— the program unveiled Friday is intended to speed up subpoena requests, give banks better data on how to detect criminal activity and build out investigations faster and more efficiently.

Under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks and financial institutions are required to send over a variety of suspicious activity reports to the federal government after detecting potential money laundering or terrorist financing.

The goal for CI-FIRST is to help financial institutions more easily detect and report financial crimes tied to fentanyl trafficking, drug trafficking, human smuggling and other crimes — by streamlining subpoena requests and improving data-sharing with banks. IRS-CI Chief Guy Ficco said in a statement that “public-private partnerships thrive when everyone mutually benefits.""

Also on Friday, IRS Criminal Investigation released new statistics highlighting how the agency has investigated financial crimes using Bank Secrecy Act data.

The agency found $21.1 billion in fraud tied to tax and financial crimes from 2022 to 2024, seized $8.2 billion in assets tied to criminal activity in the same period, and recouped $1.4 billion in restitution for crime victims, according to the agency.

“Behind all of these metrics are real crimes with real victims,” said Lauren Kohr, IRS-CI’s strategic engagement adviser. “A lot of times people look at BSA data or the Bank Secrecy Act as a regulatory requirement, but it’s really one of the sharpest tools law enforcement as a whole has to trace fraud illicit money and dismantle these criminal networks.""

""And when illicit money moves, it’s these BSA reports,"" she said ""that tell us the story.”

IRS-CI special agents ran an average of 966,900 searches annually against currency transaction reports. A currency transaction report, or CTR, is a financial document that banks are required to file with Treasury for any cash transaction exceeding $10,000 in a single day.

In the past three years, roughly 67% of cases opened by IRS-CI involved one or more currency transaction reports below $40,000, with half of currency transaction reports involving amounts less than $22,230.

Despite the majority of reports coming in below $40,000, a group of Republican lawmakers is pursing raising the threshold.

Georgia Rep. Barry Loudermilk and nine other House Republicans have sponsored a bill called the Financial Reporting Threshold Modernization Act, which would raise the currency transaction reporting and Suspicious Activity Reporting thresholds to $30,000 and $10,000, respectively, and index the CTR threshold for inflation every five years.

On April 1, the House Financial Services Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit Finance, and International Financial Institutions will hold a hearing on April 1 and the issue of CTR thresholds will come up.

Last December a Government Accountability Office report recommended Treasury help to “reduce the number of CTRs filed that are not used by law enforcement, such as by raising the reporting threshold or expanding criteria to allow for further exemptions.”

In addition to their financial crimes work, IRS Criminal Investigations has been called upon by the Trump administration to help with immigration enforcement.

Last month, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent a request to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to borrow IRS Criminal Investigation workers to help with the immigration crackdown, according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press. It cites the IRS’s boost in funding, through the $80 billion infusion of funds the federal tax collection agency received under the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act has already been clawed back.",2025-03-28T15:03:00,"['Barry Loudermilk', 'Trump', 'Kristi Noem', 'Lauren Kohr', 'Guy Ficco', 'Scott Bessent']","['the House Financial Services Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit Finance', 'Government Accountability Office', 'the Financial Reporting Threshold Modernization Act', 'The Independent', 'The Associated Press', 'BSA', 'Homeland Security', 'IRS Criminal Investigations', 'IRS-CI', 'Bank Secrecy Act', 'Treasury', 'IRS', 'the Bank Secrecy Act', 'IRS Criminal Investigation', 'International Financial Institutions', 'House', 'AI', 'CTR']",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/irs-washington-treasury-scott-bessent-kristi-noem-b2723447.html
